First, corruption *existing* in Ukraine is either here nor there.
The first is unintended consequences.
I've actually said this in another reply already.
Granted I see many Americans complained about it on the internet but their voices are not matter in the eyes of big companies
It should be a crime, or you simply don't have an opinion on it?
They could have also chosen to drive normally.
Well I used the word inexperienced, didn't I?
BUT HOW IS UKRAINIAN CORRUPTION BEING CURBED BY INVESTIGATIONS INTO *AMERICAN CITIZENS?
As a side note, I'll give you this one.
By law in most developed countries, , an employer can't discriminate based upon a protected set of grounds: race, gender, etc.
Matter of fact, Here is [Vanity Fair reporting on the potential "scandal" only a week after Biden officially launched his campaign](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/biden-ukrainian-gas-company)

It doesn't take a genius to put those together without it being spelled out.
With two versions things would be way easier and more enjoyable for all of us.
Most people take what I understand to be apprenticeships, which are selective, 2-3 year programs for specific fields and trades.
There is, however, a clear timeline that shows that the Zelensky call took place in the month between the first two Democratic debates.
Here is an article from the [NY Times dating back to 2015 asking questions about eh potential conflict of interest and appearance of impropriety of Hunter Biden's business relations coinciding with Joe Biden's official work as VP](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html).
In my case, I was lucky and nobody was coming the other way.
You would probably not go to prison at all, though you would be liable for millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit.
Regardless, I'll rephrase it like this.
Trump has been president for three years and hasn't how did he concerned about Ukraine or Joe Biden or his son.
We had a minimum wage hike of like 2 or 3 dollars a while back and most places increased the price by a few cents each month, or the portion size down.
It would have looked like obstruction if he had went public before Mueller concluded his investigation.
The situation is far fetched because of vehicular manslaughter.
Likewise if open ocean iron fertilization or deep sea carbon sequestration has a negative local impact, but is outweighed by its global positive impact, this action should also be taken.
But point is doing that alone doesn't solve the issue, since we can't catch up to our carbon output if we don't entirely kill all of our fossil fuel burning.
So when you are considering someone stupid, he is considering you stupid.
Especially considering this would leave the window open for premeditated murder while getting away with it easily.
The fact that the branches of government meant to be checks and balances on the Executive have been denied the ability to perform that vital role is entirely admissible evidence of abuse of power.

Why wasn't Trump worried about this supposed corruption in 2016 or 2017 or 2018?
That would lower the standards for vehicle safety in very real way.
Then it's accurate.
But more reckless driving is more likely to result in a terrible outcome than mildly reckless driving.
They have an ethically moral argument for being able to do so since other countries were able to.
Once you have said it, there is no going back.
The American government certainly wouldn't outsource an investigation to country that the American president believes to be corrupt.
Are you gonna tell the parents of the dead kid that it's unfortunate but that the driver only got a ticket?
I was frustrated that it took Democrats too long to point that out as well.
They explicitly make this argument in their impeachment trial briefs, and I expect it to be a major theme in their arguments today.
DOESN'T THIS RAISE RED FLAGS FOR ANY TRUMP SUPPORTER?
I think North Korea has more control over their targeting than that ...
This has been a masterful display of litigation expertise.
Again, it's not always true, but reading resumes is a hard way to find a new hire and sorting based on degree attainment is a simple way to help in that endeavor.
I can see why people think that he's just doing this because he doesn't want Biden in the race.
Job adverts always put down higher requirements than the minimum they'd accept, to try and deter people who are just spam-applying to everything that even vaguely applies to them.

How do you test if a certain technique is going to be harmful on a local, regional, and global scale without actually applying it to a local, regional, and global scale?
As I mentioned, I think Attorney General Barr should have asked Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko to investigate and that Presidents Trump and Zelensky should not have been involved.
Why does that mean the punishment should be different?
Sorry, I maybe should have phrased it differently in the title...
No, that does not change my view.
In today's modern society there is no more justification for exclusively male or female roles.
The changes you want would be changed to casting and plot.
They know exactly how often polls get it wrong and to exactly what degree they got it wrong and use that as a basis for their calculation going forward.
[In the US in 2018 it was 35% natural gas, 28% coal, 19% nuclear, and 17% renewables.
An "insult" can be part of an explanation.
The other extreme option is to only judge by consequence and not intent.
Hours were already scarce.
Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.

The second compelling argument is that it creates a moral hazard against greenhouse gas reduction.

Trump sat on the story until he saw a benefit in using it to slander the person he perceived to be his biggest political rival.
WHY WAS HE ASKING THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE TO INVESTIGATE AMERICAN CITIZENS?
edit: Sorry for my terrible English
well the only think i am accomplishing is making them feel worse and maybe making myself feel better by comparison.
It is my opinion that if we amplify our current non-geoengineering methods, then it *WILL* be enough to curb climate change to a manageable rate.
This would also explain the delay between Trump taking office and asking for an investigation.
Clarifying question: do you think manslaughter should be a crime?
**My view is that driving like an asshole/idiot is a crime and should have criminal consequences.
Sure, it might work for awhile, but it's no permanent solution.
Nor does the president of Ukraine have authority to conduct investigations into American citizens not living in Ukraine.
Coal power plants run about 40% efficient constantly.
But there's also the fossil fuels used to make the car, fossil fuels used to extract the crude oil, fossil fuel energy used to refine the crude oil into gasoline, fossil fuel used to transport the gasoline to gas stations, fossil fuel to keep the lights on at the gas stations, fossil fuel to build the gas stations, etc.
>calling someone stupid should be okay if it's true **and conversationally appropriate**
Field observations can only be done in real time, i.e.
So in essence, what you have is a political process (impeachment) that is being pursued on a strictly partisan basis alleging no *criminal* activity within the articles voted on.
By accident, all I mean is that you didn't intend for anyone to get hurt.
We still tell boys, intentionally or otherwise, that they shouldn't cry, that their feelings don't matter.

Hardly, but just because someone is stupid at one thing, doesn't mean they're entirely stupid.
I'm very clear on it not being justified for the reasons I've laid out.
Withholding exculpatory evidence makes no sense.
Really?
There are many other ways to gauge a candidate, and in my mind, the most effective ways are experiential in nature.
Because that speaks volumes.
So although one coal power plant creates way more CO2 than an individual car, a coal power plant gives off less CO2 than an equivalent amount of cars cumulatively generating the same amount of power.
If you can, CMV.
>Asking the new president who ran with an anti-corruption platform to investigate corruption isn't exactly crazy.
Peace.
Do you think that someone who drives drunk and kills someone should be charged more harshly?
They also have inquired heavily into why Giuliani, Sondland, and co. were responsible for this instead of formal channels.
Have you heard the term Toxic Masculinity?
I say that not in an attempt to insult you, but just as a statement of fact.
The long term solution is to replace gas and coal power plants with nuclear, wind, solar, and hydroelectricity.
The amount of pollution produced to move a car the same distance is much less for an electric car even when considering all of those things.
The corruption that supposedly took place was in 2014 or 2015.
I wasn't on my phone or anything, I just sort of ... didn't parse that a light was there.
But say a pedestrian was there, and I'd hit and killed them.
Why isn't he as concerned about the corruption in Russia?
** Your comment will be removed even if most of it is solid, another user was rude to you first, or you feel your remark was justified.
As electric cars become more and more prominent, there will be more and more companies taking an interest in innovating in that market space, and eventually their environmental impact will be less and less.

But that isn't the case here.
Are there people without a degree that could do the job well?
His main platform was anti-corruption, so there is a very valid argument as to why it came up on the call.
It still seems like you're talking about *what* the difference is, rather than *why* the law should treat them so differently.
Only those who actually have an aptitude for university are given access to it.
If they talk about him too much, the GOP side will just say "if you're so concerned about Hunter Biden, just bring him in as a witness".
These roles carried on forward into the post industrial era where now instead of hunting and fighting off other males, men went to work and provided for their family that way (they now had to fight off other males in a business setting).
Witness accounts are largely unreliable, and don't forget that turning can still be an accident.
This is likely   going to be come off as a bit of a harsh response response, but simply put: it is the right of an employer to decide what the requirements of a job are.
FOR TL/dr purposes, my points/questions are in all caps.
Those two statements seem pretty contradictory and an indication that your view has been changed, at least in part.
Fifth, he's been less than cooperative about the whole thing - where's are the recordings and verbatim for example?
If I could wave a wand and give every smoker a minor disease, rather than 10% of smokers a fatal one, I think that would be a good trade-off.
Now lets do the reverse, let's say running a red light without harm gets the same punishment as vehicular punishment.
Even if it wasn't ever going to, all you needed was Hunter and Joe to be afraid that it might.
Through Legal AttachÃ© offices, or Legats,Â FBIÂ personnel work with host country agencies to jointlyÂ investigateÂ crimes affecting US citizens and interests.
That has been said over and over again.

If it was just the timing, that would be one thing, but it's the whole context.
Even with a pedestrian in the crosswalk, you could range from doing no harm to minor injury, to property damage, to major injury, to killing.
Seems suspiciously selective.
Again, they report to their direct agencies, not directly to the president.
I see the flaw in my statement you'd replied to.
> Wait a minute, isn't that what we do all the time?
There's an FBI Director who is the head of the FBI.
The rest of the argument is convoluted and not relevant.
There hasn't been a movement to free men from these professions or to get women into them, only the nice positions that are safe and pay well.

Releasing two versions would not help, because the world is super connected and I guarantee that (if the international version would be criticized if it was released in America) within a week there everyone will have found out about the content of the international version and they will criticize it \*anyway\*.
You should be more clear in what defines "driving like an asshole/idiot," what the punishment should be, and how it would be enforced.
we don't know the long term effects that will occur 10, 20, 100, or 1000 years down the road.

This means we give them the freedom to hire who they want, as long as they don't discriminate against certain protected classes.

Have you mastered everything in existence?

Also I never meant that people should just go around describing people for no apparent reason.
But that's not the same as saying that it wasn't worth investigating.
It's ludicrous to believe that Trump was so concerned about the son of a politician being given a 6 figure job that he wasn't qualified for when his own WH is filled with his kids and the kids of his donors and supporters in high paying jobs they're wholly unqualified to hold.
It's literally imposibble for Conan to make that type of content sadly because certain american population would immediately call him sexist, misogynist...etc.
While conversion of vehicles to electrical, and the growing capacity of clean energy sources provides the ideal long term solution, these look to be too expensive for most of the planet to adopt in the next 20 years, so additional mitigating efforts are needed to save the planet.e Scientific consensus on anthroprogenic climate change, and that is precursor of this view which I am not interested in discussing.

Instead of making it one point, they divided it into two parts.
Truthfully, you're just rewording a lot of the same arguments that they are in fact making.
At the very least, a degree is an indicator that they're more likely to be promotable.
Because you are largely responsible for *your* actions.
That doesn't help much if the issue took place in Ukraine.
Love isn't disgusting.
They've learned from this and have made polls better going forward.
But the question is to what extent?
You will always find million people more intelligent than you some way or other
Law isn't just based on what something has been done, but also to the degree it has hurt someone, otherwise you're just going to end up with too lax or too severe punishments and that's not what law is meant to do.
I just generally meant using words like stupid which are considered offensive or wrong to say.
Only about a quarter of electricity in the US is generated by coal.

There are too many people doing too many stupid things on the road every day, and while many of them might create danger in a vacuum, a death gives us both a fixed criteria for further action and gives drivers an identifiable result to avoid.
That prosecutor was also investigating Burisma, which had hired Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.
He's saying it's justified.
**My actions would have been exactly the same**, so why in one case should I get away with a ticket at worst, and in the other case spend years in jail?
**The FBI Director is appointed for a single 10-year term by the** **President of the United States** and confirmed by the Senate.

Through this lottery, many drivers will get out scot-free (or with minor punishments), while some will be punished for killing someone.

If you had examples, I'd be happy to go into specifics.
Just because it's one action, there's still two things happening.

I think all those words should be accepted and/or discussed.
When the two options are 'working to provide for a family' and 'being provided for by someone else's work', the former *is* the freer option.
Withholding incriminating evidence makes all the sense in the world.

Of course, there are many benefits to using electric cars like less maintenance, no clutch, no gears, no oil changes, more boot space, etc which I won't deny but what I don't get is how people are made to believe that by using electric cars we can save the environment which is not true.

Beyond that, the quid pro quo is self evident, regardless of Trump's implausible denials.
You wouldn't hire an engineer who took a two month certification course on calculus and vectors and have him working on designing a new car.
Yet the guy might get offended if he were to be called inexperienced.

We would not tolerate a foreign country doing that to us any more than they would tolerate us doing that to them.

It was as obvious in May as it was in July that Biden had presidential aspirations.

Ukraine isn't hostile to us, they're dependent on our aid, are desperate to shed the spectre of corruption, and so I no reason why they wouldn't cooperate.

People are insecure and hate acknowledging their shortcomings.
After the campaign if Trump loses seems like sour grapes, and won't matter because the investigation won't happen before President Biden shuts it down.
Suddenly, just a few weeks ago, the House announced it would begin an impeachment inquiry and push for a final vote in just a matter of weeks.

No, he reports to the DOJ who reports to the President.
Part of the abuse of power allegation is the stonewalling of a co-equal branch's investigation and the refusal to release documents or allow witness testimony.

By calling you stupid, you now know why your opinion is flawed, and can fix that.

Trump has never been shy about making accusations of corruption.
Why not spare them?
The Zelensky administration, by contrast, is dedicated enough to rooting out corruption that we can trust them, but corrupt enough that we needed to suspend aid to them because of corruption concerns?

**"I started this investigation long before he was a candidate," he said.
I'm not convinced that some of the polling organizations know how to tick all of the boxes to what they are expected to provide, and leave out some data.
It often isn't because of what you *learned* from that degree but from what having that degree (or not having it) says about the applicant.
The point of having a vehicular manslaughter law is  to have a somewhat lighter punishment for manslaughter with a car because we recognize it as something people do a lot that's at a baseline pretty dangerous.

The thing is, I don't know a single Democrat who views Biden as so sacrosanct that they'd do anything to defend him.
I agree we should study it for two reasons: one, to better understand how various inputs actually change the environment versus how we assume they do now, and two, because we could use geoengineering to improve biodiversity in various regions that currently suffer from low life density.
Second, the timing: this comes out of nowhere at a pretty convenient time for Trump.
This only became of avid interest to him after Biden announced his candidacy.
A 10% chance of becoming unemployed and a 90% chance of getting a 50% pay rise seems like a pretty incredibly good gamble to take.
But that can easily be overcome by tools or training.
It was ZELENSKY who was president when Trump withheld the aid on supposed suspicion of corruption and it was ZELENSKY who Trump asked to announce an investigation.

It's not their fault that the GOP senators just don't want to hear what they're saying.

Hunter Biden had no great reason that anyone can think of to be on that board of directors (he had no special knowledge or insight regarding that country or industry), which naturally causes you to wonder if he got that job because his father was VPOTUS.
One theory based on artic deep sea core samples was that there was a major carbon sink event when the aquatic plant Azolla grew in the artic and would sink down to the floor trapping carbon when dead.

Same action, but in one case someone gets seriously hurt - even though no part of your actions differs between the two situations, even if you didn't know the dude was standing there, the outcomes are **very** different.
That Hunter Biden left Burisma years ago and was no longer a current board member or in any way affiliated.
He's also convinced that large elements of the American government are out to get him, so he runs everything through trusted off-the-books goons like Giuliani.
Basically, punching someone *really hard* should be more of a crime than punching someone *a little bit*.

To whatever extent the FBI may be able to obtain warrants and make arrests in foreign countries, they can only do so on the basis of treaties which give them that power.
So even if there is a 50% increase in minimum wage, that still only loses 10% of the minimum wage jobs.

Presidents don't decide, based on "the word is" or "many people are saying" what the FBI investigates or doesn't.
A decade ago USA entertainment was top notch on everything.
Ukraine is still under attack and occupation by Russia currently, yet Trump withheld the aid they needed to keep Ukrainian sovereignty afloat.
A US president should not be asking another country's president to announce an investigation into US citizens.
He can't have possibly (and didn't) remove everyone from the previous administration, so they withhold the money and ask him to look into this idiocy to prove himself.
Its the abuse of power and contempt of congress which is really bad, and that is exactly what they hit him with.
Is there a crime alleged that Joe Biden committed?
We ask other parts of the government to hold the corrupt politicians accountable by investigating them.
Otherwise, we end up in a situation of putting people in jail for years for a single DUI, or if that's too severe, hardly punishing people who kill, and leaving dangerously reckless people on the streets.
Similarly to how if your reckless driving results in accidental property damage you can be charged for the damage along with the reckless driving, you can be charged for killing someone on accident along with the reckless driving.
Hunter or Joe Biden called as "witnesses" to something they weren't witness to would backfire spectacularly.
Trump is trying to argue that it's illegal for Biden to have done what Trump claims, but calls himself "innocent of all wrongdoing" for having done essentially what he accuses Biden of.
However Democrats are being prevented from filling in the gaps with evidence and documents and witness testimony.
It sounds like you make more now than the "raised" minimum wage so why would it affect you?
Reiterating what I've just said: the outcomes of geoengineering are not easily predicted or observed, and as such they carry an extremely high degree of risk.
Or cases (like the punching example above) where there isn't an easy to tell how bad your actions were independent of the outcome.
> The philosophical problem you're describing is also known as "moral luck".
I agree with you, which is why there should be significant punishments for that action *whether or not you kill someone*.
But sex shouldn't play a role in choice nor selection of candidates.

The implication of "manslaughter should be the same penalty as running a red light" is that both should be a ticket; the implication of "running a red light should be the same penalty as manslaughter" is that both should be a jail sentence.

**"It shows there was a lot more collusion in Ukraine than in Russia and that Joe Biden materially assisted in getting some of that covered up, and also by the way got his son out and got a five billion dollar crooked oligarch free who is now running around Ukraine thanking Joe Biden," he charged.

Vehicular manslaughter is (generally) the crime or recklessly causing the death of another person while operating a vehicle.
I used to work at food service making $10/hr.
I'm personally not so against trading the Bidens for Bolton or Mulvaney or both, but that opens up a lot of room for the White House counsel to obfuscate the whole trial, focus everything on the Bidens, and make it so that the trial becomes a shit show about the Bidens instead of it being a trial about Trump.

>DOESN'T TRUMP HAVE A WHOLE DOJ AT HIS DISPOSAL TO INVESTIGATE ANY AMERICAN CITIZEN?
First off, the investigation into Burisma was about a time from before Hunter Biden was on their payroll, so there was no personal benefit to the Bidens to stop it.

With more and more people reaching that attainment, the people who don't reach it tend increasingly be the least qualified applicants.
That's *exactly* my point.
They can get the things that Ukraine provides, but we don't have any authority to conduct our own investigation in that country, **and we shouldn't**.
That's the foundation for the abuse of power alligation.
All of the people who actually get to make the decision here know exactly what the House managers are saying regardless of whether or not they use particularly forceful language with a lot of assumptions in it.
Yes, because many nation's education systems track people to trade schools from a young age (Germany is notorious for this).
I think the criminal punishment should be about the same in these two cases, but off the top of my head I think it should be higher than "yelled at."

The FBI (which stands for Federal Bureau of *Investigations*) is a part of the executive branch.
The US should have jurisdiction to investigate an American citizen for fraud or corruption.
This is why we have Interpol.
Trump claims to have had contemporaneous knowledge of the supposed Biden "corruption."

See my response to Dougmartin22 above, about that.

Unlike a lot of politically biased journalism and media, polling has a discrete outcome that you can judge it against.
With that qualifier, I at least mostly agree.
In court:"I lost control of the steering wheel your honor".
But every people have their own distinct and contradictory issues with American films.
I'm also not sure what it has to do with my original view.

Undoubtedly.
This is time sensitive even if the timing can be changed.
why did he prevent people from testifying?
Maybe.

No.
Manslaughter is the crime of recklessly causing the death of another person.
In both of these types of offence, there is no need to prove the *mens rea* ('Guilty mind' element of a crime), only the *actus reus* (the 'actually committed an act' element).
I don't think when it's for the sake of it.
Both an electric vehicle and abgas powered on probably have comparable production costs, but the gas vehicle will consume gasoline throughout it's lifetime, in addition to a variety of other petroleum products, that the electric vehicle won't.
Because many writers care about social justice issues and their art is often inspired by that.
Isn't that far greater abuse than they made the video game girl's titties less visible?
The reason car accidents of such a nature are considered *manslaughter* is because there was no intent behind the death, but there was still an act of negligence, and there was still a criminal offence leading to the death.
There are plenty of crimes that require intent to be proven, and people do get convicted of those crimes all the time.
It all uses the same infrastructure.
So they're a moderate improvement over traditional cars anyway.

And on average, someone with a degree is going to be more capable.
But I'm aware of any non-college journeymen programs for anything in engineering/finance/business/etc
Mick Mulvaney claimed that the aid was withheld and the investigation demanded [because of the "DNC Server.
So while they're filling a job that can be done without a degree, they're hoping to find someone that can advance.
The economic incentive of all parties is to use the cheapest form of energy, but the best outcome for all parties is the drastic global reduction of carbon, methane, and other greenhouse gasses.
> In the situation you describe, your negligence (dangerous driving) caused death.
> Like witcher series in Netflix, like black Little Mermaid
The obvious exceptions to this argument are highly-skilled and technical positions.
And as President, he's in a good position to start an investigation.
So in those cases where you do it in the worst way possible and kill someone, it makes sense to punish more severely.
I tried to stick my hand in and reached for the sock but the area was just way too narrow.
If they sample 100 people and 60 of them are women and 40 men, but they know the demographics of the area they're targeting is 51% women and 49% men, what they'll do is their weight the responses of the sampled women by the ratio of 60 to 51.
Which is not the FBI.
Is that just the only reason?
I don't think that's correct.
Not to mention inflation.
I'm a pretty small person.
But the fact that someone died was just unlucky and shouldn't cause the punishment to be significantly harsher.
Does that make sense?
Where is the backlash?
If there's a reason to investigate, Ukraine will investigate.
She can stay at home if she likes, she can work part time, she can work full time.
Why wouldn't the company just increase the price?
I think the punishment for drunk driving should not be significantly different depending on whether someone happens to die, for example.
The Biden announcement was only half of his ask.
Overall the electric car uses far less energy to run, so even if it's from coal it's using a lot less of the energy source than a gasoline engine does.

For example, asking a polling question about Hillary at a Republican or Trump rally will get you a certain set of results.
It just is?
Why not take the time to work trough proper channels and avoid implicating the president directly into something that looks *very very bad* for him?

The punishment is different because the outcome is different.
The guy doesn't have experience in any of those things and has shown to not be able to handle these things.
In the first case, you're simply breaking some traffic violations.
So the data we are able to gather, no matter how much money and resources we pump into it, will always be temporally and spatially limited.
I believe that "insults" are mainly a social construct nowadays.
But you're playing the odds.
It's true though.
You think that insults are the same thing as criticism, and that the person you're insulting has to rationally explain why you're wrong, rather than you offering an explanation of why *they're* wrong.
They're focused on one aspect, Trump's behavior, and only that.
for the netflix series, try google
Not so that you can increase the punishments on big crimes, but so you can reduce the punishments on small crimes.
It's really only worthwhile if you have a pipeline installed already.
By removing deterrent and punishment from bad luck-esq actions, you also removed a huge part of negligence or even straight up criminal behavior.
That's what I mean by the dials moving and shifting to match whatever most convenient at the time.

So when, exactly, is the right time for Trump to ask Zelensky to investigate the Bidens' involvement with Burisma?

Joe Biden allegedly got a former Ukrainian prosecutor fired for having just that suspicion.
Feminism largely believes that gender roles should be abolished altogether.

President Trump was investigating Biden back in 2018 for interference in the 2016 election.

Feminism recognizes that societal expectations of masculinity is often as oppressive as societally enforced femininity.
Does that make you feel better about yourself?
I think it was just something in my mind as "another negative aspect to our elections", It didn't fit with the topic.
The first is unintended consequences.
Second of all, Biden has admitted that unless a prosecutor was fired, he would withhold US aid to Ukraine.
If someone is selfish, they should be okay being called selfish.

They're withholding far more than they've released.
How can Biden possibly be judged "guilty of corruption" when there was never even the investigation Trump wanted?

I agree.
It proves that Trump was trying to have his 2016 advantage artificially re-enacted.
They have insulted more.
I mean, Depending on what your doing, your job is probably already at risk to being lost to a robot.
So what's the use of calling it environment-friendly when many factors suggest it isn't.
It seems like a perfect comprimize.
I think this is the crux of what I'm not seeing.
Since nobody has found a better reason than that latter fact for Hunter to be on Burisma's board, asking about the meaning of that makes sense.
Btw, I don't think sarcasm is a great idea in a serious discussion, especially over text.

Giant gaming companies and Hollywood studios routinely censor themes and material because they fear offending more socially and politically conservative international audiences and not being able to get past the censors in those countries, especially China.

The value they measure is something called "elasticity" which tells you for what percent increase of minimum wage you'd expect to see what percent decrease in jobs.

Isn't this one of the FBI's roles, to conduct investigations in coordination with foreign authorities?
So, for example, if you poll people asking them if they'll vote for Hillary or Trump, they know to switch half the questions and instead ask Trump or Hillary.
Journalists then comb through that data and choose what to report on and what not to report on.
We haven't had a president with as consistent approval ratings since Nixon.
That being said it would also be possible for gasoline engines to become efficient enough to be more eco friendly than electric cars if government's weren't pushing so hard for electric vehicles.
In reality, the enforcement of those laws, the choice of the prosecutor to subsequently press charges, and the verdict and sentence handed down by the judge and jury massively depend on those details and are not restricted to the laws on the books.
The way to handle disputes between co-equal branches of government is through the third co-equal branch...the judiciary.
I don't really have much of an opinion on whether it should be illegal to drive like an idiot in a context where you can really be sure there's no one else around.
This is especially true if you look at polls with a rating of A or B (which would roughly correspond to the "pollsters who know what they're doing and want to represent reality accurately").
>WHY WOULD TRUMP ASK A COUNTRY HE SUSPECTS IS CORRUPT FOR AN INVESTIGATION?
There are a lot of really solid polling organizations out there such as Pew and Gallup.
Some philosophers argue that and that is reasonable.
By using an insult in this situation instead of weighing pros and cons in a constructive way, all you will get is hostility and hurt.
There isn't some government agency to  determine that however, and it would be ridiculous and far too subjective a task to try to determine what the educational requirements for every job listing is.

Your actions would *not* have been exactly the same.
Generally, pollsters release **all** of the data collected in a poll.
It didn't see the construction worker, the logger, the sewage worker, the fireman, the trucker.
Most people (myself included) go to university and sink tens of thousands of dollars into something that I may not even involve myself in later in life or at all even.
You can say anything provided you are ready to accept the consequences
Would you say that if you intent for someone to get killed but you failed the punishment should be the same as if you succeed?
In addition, I agree with your point that people often take a single poll as evidence for their viewpoint in an argument, but using a collection of polls from quality pollsters is actual evidence that someone could use to make a point.
For example: A girl just moved in with a guy.
Nope, because you have to be able to *prove it*.
Even so, the prosecutor that Biden worked to help remove was removed specifically because he *wasn't* investigating allegations of corruption in Ukraine.
We need equality in choice.
They don't need to impress anyone else.
Polls are an inexact science, I agree.
Just because one American citizen was formerly involved with Burisma (were the Bidens the ONLY Americans involved with Burisma?
Both men and women can hold toxic views about masculinity.
He was wholly uninterested until Biden announced his candidacy 4 years after the fact, then all of a sudden Burisma and Hunter Biden became a big issue for Trump.

They weren't making direct arguments towards Trump's guilt, instead focusing on how their evidence from the House hearings makes Trump appear guilty and there should be more evidence in the trial to give them more detail.
I would think that 1 Bn a year would be able to fund large scale experiments for several of the more promising approaches with about half of that, as well as hundreds of research grants for laboratory tests.
I'm going to start by adding a qualifier:
The endgoal is near zero emissions, and that's impossible when everyone drives gas vehicles.
I do appreciate the proper pollsters, but I was just replying to another comment about an article I read a few years ago about political organizations with money, starting their own "polling data & analysis" companies, who end up not only skewing the poll results to be favorable for the party who hired them (ie: their own party), and make a shit ton of money off of them in the process.

Please be as detailed as possible and maybe give me examples if possible?
If I had not called you stupid, then my third paragraph is something you would have paid attention to.
In fact, even when he ends up claiming to care all along, Trump makes no move on Ukrainian corruption.
For example, a sock fell in this hard to reach spot once.
Since the constitution does not define "misdemeanors", we are left o assume the common law definition, which still includes a statutory offense.
Like witcher series in Netflix, like black Little Mermaid, like female ghostbusters...etc.

Those things can absolutely be used to argue the House's case.
This already happens?

That could be to a position that does need a degree.
Just as for women, there are certain behaviours that are considered proper for a man and other's that aren't.
So what might be a statement of fact to you might not be for another.
We don't know if Biden did anything corrupt, but Trump is all ready to call him corrupt based solely on his FEELINGS, but without any evidence to back it up.
This is my point, before I replied I sat here and tried to think of a time when it makes sense to call someone stupid.
If I were POTUS, that's how I'd have done it.
"For two years, members of this Committee have declared that criminal and impeachable acts were established for everything from treason to conspiracy to obstruction.
Or maybe you want to vet out and idea or help a friend by giving them advice.
Furthermore, Trump's claim that his inquiry to Zelensky about the Bidens was made out of Trump's sudden desire to root out Ukraine corruption, right?
I didn't say with or without anything.
More people are going to run red lights and more people are going to get killed because you've just lessened the punishment.
That's like saying your local Amazon distribution center isn't part of Amazon Corporate because it reports to a regional office.
Possible.
The overall point here is that we can SEE what Trump did and there's not even any dispute about it.
He said he withheld the aid because of suspected corruption.
First, there's the nature of the request: he's not asking for an investigation, he's asking *very specifically* for an announcement.
In jobs that are vulnerable to automation, the only reason they're not yet automated is because the initial cost of replacing workers with machines is high and the continuing cost of employing people is lower than that.
Women were subjugated in their limited role and were not taken as seriously, she was under her husbands thumb but received physical protection for her and her children, as well as provisions.
I'm not weighing on the validity of the allegations, I'm just stating what the case is.
Who's to say that the Ukrainian investigation wouldn't have expanded to look at Hunter Biden?
In this case we have no control, though.
> The goal was to replace him with someone that would do more, not someone that would stop investigating.
Arguments about the time it takes to work through courts are fairly easily dismiss not only because courts can fast-track cases, but also because house democrats themselves delayed in sending the articles to the senate, and now insisting on prolonging the rules debate by introducing every rule amendment separately and unnecessarily  prolong the process.
Now they have waste time to go and return the dress.
The timing  makes perfect sense.
Because he doesn't suspect that *all of Ukraine* is corrupt.
I mean why do you think he's being impeached?
Still food service is not my thing and I'd rather stay with the job I have now until I finish college.
My thoughts about that last statement about the last general election have changed due to another comment so we are now in agreement about that.

> WHY WOULD TRUMP ASK A COUNTRY HE SUSPECTS IS CORRUPT FOR AN INVESTIGATION?
>Also - as a kind of thought experiment why don't I make the counter-argument and we can see how you argue the point?
Trump had no problem with corruption in Ukraine before and was even perfectly happy sending them money.
For instance, a key piece of the Democrats' argument has been that Trump did not actually give a shit about corruption in Ukraine.
So this would absolutely be an example of Ukrainian corruption in that they're essentially paying Hunter Biden to get Joe Biden push out their own politicians.
I really don't mean to.
Put cholera in a city's water supply?
They raised the minimum wage in ontario from 10 to 14, and literally nothing happened.
Because corruption isn't the same across the whole government.
On the other hand, if I were to say something like "you won't get in easily on the airplane because of your size", why is that bad?
But wait!
It doesn't when you consider the previous Ukrainian administration was considered corrupt and that Zelensky was only elected in April of 2019.
Within the context of Black Panther, it matters which characters are of which race.

The philosophical problem you're describing is also known as "[moral luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_luck)".
But it isn't necessarily possible to adjust for every possible factor and part of it is just learning as we go and respecting that that is part of why polls have error margins.
This could then be compared to typical variation over the same period and compared in a significance test.

4.
My question is why is it "bad" to use "insults"?
If a foreign leader had taken office in 2014 and suspected corruption involving the Obama administration, wouldn't it make sense for them to wait until 2016 and see if a different administration took over that would actually be interested in uncovering the corruption.
As I've said in another thread, I think that Attorney General Barr should have spoken to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General about the Bidens and that both presidents should have stayed out of it.
If we punish adults in the same was a children, then it becomes hilariously easy for terrible people to get away with their crimes, because all they have to do is not have any evidence proving they intended to be harmful.
