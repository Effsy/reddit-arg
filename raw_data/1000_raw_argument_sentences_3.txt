The motivation for the age restriction, like a lot of the Constitution, might have roots in the political situation in Europe in the 1700's.
If Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez wanted to run for President in 2020, and people thought she was too young and inexperienced, they could vote against her for that reason.
(Various articles I could quote to support this lmk) Women generally live a couple years longer.
Why, exactly?
The minimum age requirement does at least give you some potential limit as to which someone can fill out a political 'resume', at the very least make themselves a known quantity, giving people better ideas as to what sort of a person a politician is/can be, while setting a maximum only hampers potentially still competent, still capable public servants from fulfilling an important role.

Whenever some piece of government is less efficient than families or the private sector, it makes me point out that most pieces of the government are *more* efficient, and it only seems to be controversial ones that get caught in situations like that.
By that logic, it almost seems like releasing them from prison is crazy.
Also you didn't mention morals in your original post.
There are moral cases for any of these, at the end of the day the system is the way it is because so many people have varied and vehement opinions on what's moral in this area.
But it could be as simple as economic retribution.
That could be for financial crimes that lead to direct harm, and can indirectly lead to physical harm, as in the case of the scammer who takes an old person's retirement money and that person can no longer afford to heat their home.

To me, that's a sign of a teacher who is taking the easy way out, and isn't fulfilling their duties.
Some people just can't teach and shouldn't be teachers.
And because of the way teachers jobs work where I'm from, he hasn't lost his job after his failures when he taught my parents, and he's still teaching now, decades later, still not passing any knowledge on.
They will also fire teachers for not completing their certification in time, and then put subs with no certification in those classrooms.
Why we should: taxpayers deserve some accountability around how their taxes are spent and parents deserve information about how good their school is.

If you try to bring up the fact that millions of people following 1 religion in the current age have some horrendous beliefs and practices (and that religious group also happens to be heavily scrutinized at this point in history due to a misrepresentation of a tiny, terroristic minority of that group) your argument is generally immediately shit on because you're assumed to be xenophobic or racist.
Also because of the risk of prejudice / somewhat colonial entitlement, it causes Muslims to feel attacked.
Christianity is going to cause a lot more issues in America as there are much more Christians than muslims.

This is a lesson that is valuable because once they have reached a certain age responsibility will become unavoidable and learning how to handle them at an early age gives the children a head start.

Any of those three would be our oldest president if elected, that is a concern, both for their mental health and the simple possibility of them kicking the bucket while in office, leaving us with a VP who might not be what people wanted when they voted for the presidential candidate.

Why I think there's a difference between the two scenarios which I think I'm now repeating is the difference between the sizes of the roles the intoxication plays in whether or not they (the other parties in both scenarios) want to have sex with the intoxicated.

Not every gay person is part of it, and it has issues, but it's very much a community.
Their experience of dating and life is different enough to be its own thing.
And when you enter that real place, gay people have a different set of norms, developed by them because no one in society tells you how to flirt with someone your own sex.

* Online marketing explicitly targeting teenagers and making unscientific promises that vaping is allegedly safe.
That doesn't completely discredit my view that there is no proof that these types of vapes are not harmful, because it's true that there is no proof *YET* , but I now see that it is foolish to believe that they aren't harmful when there's such a high likelihood that we just don't know about it yet.
You're right though that ceramic coils and the like target the poorer vice victims.
These "28+ years old vapers" were former smokers who started when they were younger as you admit when you say "they switched"
I am focusing on specifically respiratory or systemic health risks associated with vaping.
Again, if you stay sane, keep a safe distance you won't be in any danger at all.
Typically the intention when brake checking is to discourage someone from tailgating.
Well i agree but most every time i get tailgated im going 10 miles over the speed limit so i slow down to the speed limit and put on cruise control to make them mad

Learn about the subject the best way you can, and vote accordingly to what you believe is best.
Every major decision should be seen as one time deal.
I'm just saying a blanket rule doesn't apply.

It's a common problem, but in my mind, it's an extremely important one to address in society.
And here is the flaw of representation.
It becomes a contest of advocation, which creates all the flaws we see today.
Entire education up to college to teach kids "classical" education could be easily done in vastly shorter time by a 12 year old on a year course rather than years upon years wasted by XIX century school system designed around 8h shift.

So, If you really want to learn something and become a professional but not talent then school is good for you and this is probably one best way to learn something.
Also, it's riskier to go out into the world without a college education and make something of yourself, but sometimes you gotta risk it to get the biscuit.

How is determining whether someone has those skills and appeal different from determining whether they are electable?
You are still using electability as the primary criteria, you are just questioning whether most primary voters have the discernment to figure out what characteristics correlate best with electability.

In that forum, the opposition can't defend themselves, so it's politically more advantageous.
Thus we get what we get.
The fact that these are so clearly seen as sides is maybe emblematic of how deep the hyperpartisan problem runs.
They're also seductive, because they FEEL super powerful and awesome and killer, and they allow you to attack someone's position without ever taking a stand yourself that could be attacked.
EDIT: Also the house is still investigating.
Public defenders are not elected AT ALL.

Now, this doesn't mean that an elected representative shouldn't be sensitive to the needs of their constituents or communications that they receive from constituents - but it does mean that they aren't beholden to do anything that they didn't run on doing.
Greek organizations raise a multitude of funds  for various philanthropies.
It is just some sort of expensive club where you have to live in the club's house, go to parties to get drunk so you may fit in to only get your **stomach pumped** two hours later, and possibly be ***drugged*** ***and/or raped.
In essence, give me a reason why it should.

A good Greek Life Alumni system will make it much easier to get the job that you want.
It doesn't look like it's the case, as most scientific texts are maximally dense (i.e.

You want to find the facts, deliberate using logic, and come to a conclusion based on all the information at your disposal.
There have been times I wanted to say something and I wrote it first to get it straight.
1) You don't care about politics but want to avoid social problems.
Whom you vote for is secret.
See how letting people outside of your party vote in the primary changes the dynamics for the worse in the current system?
The first example I gave was someone who wanted Sanders, then Trump, then other democrats, which actually happened in the 2016 election.
Now republicans vote and elect Warren as the nominee.
I suppose you wouldn't advocate changing this too?

Being able to walk away from those who's values don't align with your own is usually a good thing.
>Lots of this cited language is so common that to challenge and educate people on it is just obnoxious.
In Virginia, the legislators there are trying to pass a extreme form of gun control and confiscation.

More liberal people think it's about having a right to a militia which they think is canceled out by the military while more conservative people think it's about personally owning guns.
So I didn't used to hold this view, and used to think that the notwithstanding clause was a weak-kneed way of undermining the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
We've basically left the door open to outright fascism if the will was there.
To be a licensed mental health professional, you have to go through a lot of schooling, at minimum a master's degree in the US.
When I began to study Christianity (I tried many others), I encountered the Holy Spirit and God revealed himself to me and healed me from mental illness and shame.
(And again: Personally, I think you'd be surprised.)
Because of this belief , it keeps you stuck and unable to see beyond your self.

On medicare for all, they only focus on the initial cost and how will will affect the insurance companies not on all the other problems it helps to solve like preventing disease.
Being an attorney myself, I can tell you that you have to be especially unqualified for the ABA to outright say it.
Pro-education republicans are are also very well camouflaged, then, but they can certainly learn a thing or two from the pro-sex-education republicans.
It's about controlling women.
Universities are not obligated to provide mental health care.
More and more people are coming forward about struggling with mental health issues and due to this we are realising some systems dont work for a subset of people.
In the case of high school teens and younger students, I understand the need for these services since you may want privacy and not want parents to know sometimes.
Sure, but someone who is specialized in problems with learning and studying and knows the specific university you are attenting is going to be able to help you a lot more than a regular therapist from outside of the university.

In which case, I could see a bit of a thrill, but its not about the suffering or mourning, it's more about the details and the investigation.
But that doesn't necessarily mean they feel no emotion or sadness.
I've been to concerts there many times, it's a nostalgic place for me.
The only thrill I can picture is a bit tangential and would only come up in stories like the Vegas Shooter.
I could have had friends there (in the end, I didn't).
It seems like you don't actually believe that underage drinking is wrong, but that irresponsible drinking is wrong, and that people who are underage tend to drink irresponsibly.
Alcohol creates problem in development of young people, but does so only until way lower than current "legal age" in US which is riddiculous.
And even some states in the USA allow you to drink from any age as long as it's in a private residence.
I think my experience with my peers drinking so far has made me correlate underaged drinking to being irresponsible drinking.
Was it right?
But   what if you could have programs like the ones in Overlord?

This means that immigration law has always been a frequent conversation, since our laws have changed bit by bit for a hundred years.
The largest ongoing refugee crises are Venezuela, Syria, South Sudan, and Myanmar.
The positive side of authoritarianism is that now China has fully recognized the issue, it can mobilize a lot of resources very effectively to shut it down, and I don't think India would necessarily have handled it better just because they're a democracy.
Similar things are hidden from all of us because this is what they want to do no matter the political regime.

You can't even compare the two systems.
The idea that people tend to overreact to news and may not do the correct things in Western nations as well isn't wrong- but that's not the point here.

Perhaps there's another metric that is more consistent in growth that we could model increase in wages upon.
This is not the employer's responsibility, but the employees.
> thout a mandated wage increase that matches GDP growth, people are unable to afford basic necessities
This allows it to reduce costs without a pay cuts or other reductions.
That's not my true nature.
Arguments in favor of the view OP is willing to change must be restricted to replies to other comments.

Overhead expensesÂ include accounting fees, advertising, insurance, interest, legal fees, labor burden, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel expenditures, and utilities.
When you increase a business's overhead, the workers and the consumers are the ones who are going to feel it.
But now knowing what we know in that article, that actual companies did raise their minimum wage, and employers aren't afraid to expect more out of their employers, then how on earth could this happen, that the number of jobs and number of hours worked actually did NOT change?
High costs of living lead people to campaign for minimum wage hikes, which then seem to have minimal further impacts on the cost of living.
Owners making too much is more of a moral argument.

Much in the same way the Joker dresses up as a clown that makes people happy when he usually just makes them sad or mad.
In both cases (and I think 2019 Joker too) He wanted to CONVINCE people... to demonstrate his philosophy's correctness and prove to Batman that the world isn't fair.
If killing the Joker accomplished that they would relish it.

In this particular case, the EOL was announced 2 months in advance.
Perhaps we could add that this person doesn't want to use the new product, but continue with the product he paid for.

I accept that a Linux user who unwittingly bought the game after the announcement - and wouldn't have bought the game had they known - is entitled to a refund.
Does it make any more sense for Epic to continue supporting a product for this few people?

Because that's not what I asked.
This makes them even more threatening if you're in one of those groups.
I mean to take your auto accident example, statistically you're most likely to be killed by a white driver, and you're also most likely to be assisted by a white person if you were injured in a car accident... but that has nothing to do with white people as a race and is purely a result of them being an overwhelming portion of the population.
"Which of these labels is stronger correlated with being a terrorist", is a completely separate question from the original one, of which of these two is a bigger domestic threat.

Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.
For example in one U.S. state saying "thank you, ma'am" may be considered impolite because you are assuming someone's gender or making them feel aged, in another state it would be considered impolite *not* to say "ma'am" or "sir" when talking to someone.
Inborn preferences are just human preferences, more instinctual or soft wire based.

I am definitely not knowledgeable to know all the reasons why a person has to consume meat.

Sometimes, the only way to acquire the evidence is for a judge to outright tell them they can just go and get it, provided they have *evidence of evidence* to kick start that.
I agree in general that no-knock warrants should be the exception and only issued after careful scrutiny, but the arguments you make are just silly.

Surely Christians are also driven by 'fanatical devotion to the single charismatic leader' (god/Jesus), who also needs his followers to rely only on him?
A cult is a religious group that holds beliefs that are not generally accepted by the majority.

They want a truck for the cool factor, but don't want to be accused of compensating for a small dick, so they go with the option that's seen as more "practical".

If you put a tax on something proprietary, you discourage it unless the customer wants it.

I agree that this should be something to strive for, but in the desire to lower waste, they're likely gonna increase it because of the costs.
I'd also state the preponderance of 'nationwide injunctions' that have happened under Trump will likely bite the Democrats in the ass later too.
So I don't think that Republicans have to consider what kind of precedent Trump's policies will set at all.
There is a rich history of each party one-upping the other (and regretting it later)
What I'm disagreeing with is the idea that Republicans have to worry about whether it's constitutional or not.
I would tell you that it is more of a follow on to the actions of Obama.
>Given the long history of genocide and crimes by communists and Marxists, I think the Pinochet approach is well justified even if said Marxist is a "democratic" one.

Leading to conservatives supporting fascists until they're as well thrown under the bus because fascists don't like to share their power...

Your argument may as well be: "Who cares if they use slave labor, I like cheap clothes."
