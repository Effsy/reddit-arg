If would have a modest positive benefit on growth.
I don't see the benefits of holding on to debt that can't be repaid.
If you or anyone cared about fairness everyone would have the same yearly salary.
Reversing the tax cuts and forgiving student loans would put the government in a similar, if not stronger, fiscal position.
Millions of people have taken out student loans that will not be able to pay.
It would be strange to begrudge them something like that.
Loan forgiveness is a tool we can use as we push towards affordable education.
If government bails out group X, how is that fair to group Y who go no bailout?
Just because one person overcame an issue doesn't mean another shouldn't get help.
Furthermore, it will benefit most those with degrees that are not in demand.
What exactly is the problem with someone pursuing an art degree for free?
I think these approaches address the root of the problem.
How would this cripple the economy, I still don't understand.
What evidence are you looking for specifically?
So what?
I agree that education is good yet you haven't shown me any evidence that student loan forgiveness is a good idea.
> For starters it does nothing to educate young people of the consequences of loans and even decision making.
As for fairness, this isn't really important to the discussion at hand.
We could and should do both.
However, a student with an Art degree won't make is much and is in less demand by the market and employers.
That said, subsidizing a degree in art is more likely than not going to result in in getting that money back and then plus some.
"Young people" aren't monkeys working on the sole basis of their last stimulus.
Cancelling student debt can potentially **cripple the economy**.
Recently, an Iowa dad confronted Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren over her plan to forgive / cancel student loan debt.
Furthermore, edification has a net positive on society as a whole, because we live in a democracy and it's better for people to be educated than not.
> There is a bigger issue here for society.
But of course, that all changed after 2008.
It's kind of a shitty attitude to say that we shouldn't do a good thing just because it'll be unfair to people.
What is clear is the fact that the government holds most of this student debt and if cancelled, the government would lose billions of forfeited student loan principal, interest and fees.
The US is lagging behind other nations in education and, in an increasingly technical global economy, having an educated population will allow to continue to compete globally without having to incentivise skilled immigration into our country.
> Source: National Center for Education Statistics.
That's counter to your point - like saying you think car safety is good but you don't see any reason to ensure all cars have seatbelts.
Do you think people should only be allowed to be educated in fields the "market" demands?
Should the government just never try to fix any situation or hardship because it's unfair to people who previously had to suffer?
Educating younger people on personal finance - Adding a personal finance class to high school curriculums that cover the consequences and benefits of loans.
Instead, they are flocking to high-paying specialties like cardiology that already have a relative surplus.
Why does fairness matter?
That would make the current generation of debt-laden graduates on the hook for both their loans, and the tax burden of free college moving forward.
Does it?
Maybe you could link some sources explaining this point better.
However bailouts for banks, auto companies or in this case students with outstanding loans do nothing to fix the root of the problem.
Why do you think these have to be alternatives?
Also your idea number 3 that is a 'better alternative', isn't that just as 'unfair' as debt cancellation?
If you or anyone cared about fairness, every athlete would be the same height and weight.
Cancelling student debt is **unfair.
To the latter part of my post, I mentioned some alternatives that I think are better approaches to the student loan problem.
> Cancelling student debt is unfair.
Millions of middle and lower class people spending money on consumer goods and services is FARRRR better at stimulating the economy than additional tax cuts for rich people.
If you agree education is good why do you think we have to punish people seeking education?
Yes, doctors will maximize their chances of repaying their loans by going into specialty care, instead of the primary care needed in rural America.
Whether or not the bride agrees is a different question and I'm certainly not arguing the guy in the AITA was an asshole.
Then the funds aren't separate.
But it's both of their money, right?
That's probably not the best case to use as an example.
So the 'values of the couple' at play here are just the groom being selfish and controlling about money that wasn't even technically his money to begin with.
"For example if the bride falls in love with an inexpensive dress, but the groom wants a more expensive dress.
Again, we can take 5%, i.e.
This post has gotten a lot of attention:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/eoley4/aita\_i\_38\_m\_for\_telling\_my\_fiancee\_f\_27her/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/eoley4/aita_i_38_m_for_telling_my_fiancee_f_27her/)  and it's sparked a few conversations.
Like you say that the money is shared, but the AITA OP says that they each put in 10k for the wedding and his(hopefully now ex-)fiancee made a post on r/relationships that he lied a lot in his post and she actually put in 15k and he only put in 5k.
I agree that people might not be contributing the same but I don't think that matters.
But I mean people are bringing up interesting points so I think my current view still has people who disagree
Yes, there's a premium associated with it, but it's still a labor intensive proposition.
We usually split the bill on large incidental purchases that will benefit us both, except when one partner wants something that costs more money than the other is willing to invest.
It's her money, too.
You're misrepresenting the post, it isn't 20k from a joint account, it's that they both contributed 10k towards the wedding.
the groom-to-be should have some say as is the case with any large purchase.
3.
Instead of listening to her, or asking input from others, he just assumed that a $100 dress would be fine.
The guy seemed pretty manipulative and abusive.
That's why I'm not arguing he's not an asshole.
My biggest point is that circumstances really matters and both partners should be well informed about each other's finances and expectations, far before planning the wedding.
I don't agree with some of the rest about a suit, but for argument's sake I'll agree.
The problem is that you don't get to see that dress.
Beyond that, both me and my husband can buy anything we want.
That's also why I'm just saying they have $20k total and it doesn't matter who put in what.
Its not really a groom or husband's place to be telling his bride or wife how to dress.
You have no idea what it looks like, how it will fit, and what it will feel like.
So, he contributed what he thought was a reasonable price for a new vacuum cleaner, and I paid the rest.
We each pay our own cell phone and transportation bills.
In a situation like that where most of the money is coming from one party it makes sense to give that person greater control over the money, potentially including the unilateral ability to spend large chunks of it.
For example if the bride falls in love with an inexpensive dress, but the groom wants a more expensive dress.
Just because people share costs doesn't mean they necessarily share them equally.
The bride's family just gives them $20k and says whatever you don't spend on the wedding goes to you or the honeymoon.
We don't have to take the exact specifics of this case but just theses nuts and bolts:
Mostly because I'd want her opinion, but even I didn't, I wouldn't just spend $1k and not consult her.
Wedding dresses are small batch, and very labor intensive to make.
It's more like a men's suit than a car.
I'm not trying to argue he's not the asshole.
The goal of a relationship is to maximize total happiness, not win the most points.
I think the groom was a dick and in the AITA context, he should stfu.
So it's not that the bride wanted to spend 5% of the wedding fund on her dress, it's that the bride wanted to spend 1k of her own money on her dress.
If there's a large argument over a dress or over the handling of money, it's likely not going to work.
What if her family is paying for the wedding and you're just given a certain total budget?
Instead of a 1k wedding dress,  he was pushing her to buy a $100 dress.
It really depends on the arrangement they have, surrounding their finances.
they ultimately share money such that the costs one spends, even on personal stuff, directly effects how much money the partner has.
The broader point here is not every couple cares about beautiful weddings and the groom isn't inherently and asshole for arguing with the bride that spending $1k on a wedding dress isn't the best way they could use their money but rather a social construct being pushed on us by the wedding industry.
The couple shares their money.
Whether it be a joint account, an joint and personal account, etc.
In other words if you're a couple that's throwing an extravagant wedding with a bunch of people and you want everyone to look their best then it's completely reasonable to spend a lot on the wedding dress even if you'll wear it once.
Get a less harmful hobby.
Get a less harmful hobby.
My only argument to change OPs mind is this:
I think you are really reaching if you read that as wanting to legally enforce the ban on cosmetics
[See the wiki page for more information](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5).
At this definition of harms you can justify anything.
Its delusional if they do.
>In places where cosmetic use is rare and far in between, studies shown they are more likely to engage in relationship and judgement based on the character of a person than how they look.
Cosmetics are used in movies, art, plays, etc to make people look like something they are not, for example painting your face like a cat so you can star in that new Catz musical movie thing.
Cosmetic are not healthcare products, last I checked, but some cosmetics could be infused with some "health stuff" for marketing values.
I wasn't intending to say everyone, I was intending to say for the individual person using it.
I have the same views for clothing and hair too.
> **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP's stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.
*>  may be a strong advocate of utility and efficiency,* 
Not all cosmetics are bad for the environment or for one's health.
Don't get me wrong, I am all for civil liberty, prochoice and bodily freedom but when your liberty and freedom is doing more internal and external harm than any foreseeable  good, you have to find something else to express your "individuality".
Embracing eros leads one to embrace philia and agape.
The world will still have deceit, but makeup won't be the reason for it.
Yes we should do more reading, exercising and learning.
Should we not get tattoos or piercing?
Instead they should be camouflaged to avoid predators.
what is the biggest harm that it causes?
The things you put on canvas or artistic objects would probably disfigure your face.
If everyone stopped doing it we'd probably all develop much healthier standards for what makes a person physically attractive too.
Third: You made no compelling argument in the first place.
If you want to get rid of cosmetics because they're wasteful, we should probably get rid of most movies, tv shows and sporting events too.
So presumably you also wouldn't want anyone wearing anything other than brown canvas sacks, because personal expression is fake and vain?
Also, what about the men that do wear it and see it as a form of self expression?
Most people don't care about their appearance to hide their true nature - they do it precisely to make sure that the best version of their true nature is the one on display.
Consumer awareness is reducing (not yet eliminating) environmental harm relating to production.
What evidence is there of cosmetics making people behave worse?
We need it in our lives.
Is brown canvas sack comfortable and practical for all situations and jobs?
It does not try to hide its own nature.
This is against the rules.
Regarding the psychological effect, I think I perceive it as some form of insecurity, but never thought of it as they look prestigious or promiscuous as said in the links you provided.
If your hobby is causing harm, its not your freedom to keep doing it.
She didn't propose a ban on cosmetics or anything though.
Maybe you'll say all these things are wasteful and should be done away with.
[removed]
Cosmetics make people behave worse?
What is vanity but one more anchor for a social connection, for mates at the end of the day?
No jewelry?
Decorations which are wasteful, environmentally harmful, psychologically negative overall and absolutely optional when we have better things to do for improving our quality of lives.
Good points there.

Do you think people should stop cutting or dyeing their hair?
Then again, I'm speaking as a male who's wife takes altogether too long to get ready every day so perhaps I'm biased.
I could apply the same argument to big budget movies, to indy films.
should we all also wear plan basic clothing and get buzz cuts?
If you want to live a happy life and make good decisions then you have to ask the most important question: how do you know the things you claim to know?
But Cultural Appropriation is a term that absolutely makes sense within its academic context.
If a term is not fitting or you don't know how to name it you can use additional more basic words to describe your thoughts.
She clearly wasn't using the correct term.
For instance, I could say I'm trying to research the effects of a specific educational intervention (direct instruction, discovery learning, guided self-study, ...) on student outcomes.
Also, again, sexism and racism aren't inherently political things.
Or you can try two different definitions and see if they both work, only one works or neither works.
My general view can be summarized as: use of a word that is well backed up within its own context is fine.
People use the word "work" in many different, colloquial ways, but if you take an intro to physics class they point out that in order to make any deductions about "work" in the universe, scientists had to give it a very specific meaning: W = Fd.
And trust me, they WERE radical.
I'm going to repeat for clarity and to make sure I understand, substituting my understanding of your definition fo context in this sentence:
I argue that because we are from different parts of the world, we use the same words to mean different things.
So say you have a brand new concept you want to introduce into the world.
Before you ever get into an argument make sure you have defined your terms.
So are hand/finger movements automatic while playing an instrument ?
Ultimately it's their choice to wear it.
They can define terms all she wants, but no amount of redefining will change the argument as to whether it is *okay* to wear certain hairstyles.
Well...
words change all the time.
You answer "Yes."
I agree they exist on the same spectrum and that the difference would be degree.
Thus, I'm holding the substance of the universe before the Big Bang in my hands".
And I also agree there.
Copyright protections, trademarks, patents, etc.
The example I was given was dreadlocks.
Seriously?
My wife grew up in a french household and in her mind, "entrée" means "appetizer".
Did I change your view then?
Who cares.
Or, for example a term which usually needs a concrete subject, used without a concrete subject (eg.
So when your mother says she's using her own definition for "automatic", she's perfectly entitled to that, but then you can draw it back to the original argument and challenge the *content* of her word.
You were no longer exchanging ideas about the topic, just the about words.
For example, in transgender topics, people often have debilitating focus on the definitions of words.
And either way, using an academic version of a word in casual context doesn't mean you are making up a definition or using a personal definition simply because the other person isn't aware of something.
So I don't consider taking up another cultures idea without understanding it is wrong.
Well I wasn't aware that there weren't radical leftist who believe in such things.
What's the word to describe this behavior in a casual context?
Mickey Mouse is the biggest example: Walt Disney appealing to Congress to expand copyright protections over and over to protect their cultural mouse!
The person is using it wrong, but the context around it does make it easy to understand what the meaning is.
Because I'm sure there were people like you who were saying "it's not a masterpiece because it wasn't the best piece made by a master!"
Otherwise the argument becomes purely semantic, arguing over definitions of words rather than the concepts they point to.
And we could go on like idiots arguing about whose car is better, OR we could actually figure it out by defining the term "better" (the dictionary doesn't help here).
Similarly, your other argument was about hairstyles.
To conclude, you **can** justify your argument with your own definition, but you need to do so clearly.
Depending on where you grew up or your life experiences a word may have a completely mean to you that is fully valid (ex Sherman for a WW2 vet vs a reconstructionist).
Sure, when I wrote that comment I had in mind political groups that systematically do that.
Literally high school debate but whatever
In debate i've learned an important thing, get definitions correct before you debate.
By focusing on the dictionary definitions of the words rather than the definitions the person was using, you block the other person from communicating their ideas, and yourself from understanding them.
Whereas a culture doesn't own the ideas it makes, especially when considering that various cultures came up with the same ideas Independently.
My argument wasn't that Democrats are objectively better because I agree with what they have to say.
Tax cuts, regulation reduction, 3.7% unemployment.
There is always the pretense presented that when your party was in power, they did this so the other party should too.
A party of family values.

None of the above statements are wrong, but only half of them are objective.
I made no comment about anything else.
They are willing to compromise to get most of their agenda in a larger coalition.
There are many great quotes from Pelosi saying you have to pass something to know whats in it to Obama stating elections have consequences.
They care about policies impacting them.
So the democrats are expected to come up with proposals for incrementally opening up the social hierarchy.
The difference between the two instances being that Democrats actually care about the character of a person in power and their moral values.
I would frame this as the Republican are taking a more utilitarian approach.
Republican in office.
Republican answer: "Elections have Consequences".
they wanted to build a wall at the Mexican boarder,  start a trade war with China, and cut taxes.
Republicans haven't had any actual policies that they're trying to put into place to improve people's lives.
>Republicans don't actually care about any of the things they claim to represent.
Sure, some might not understand the values or know what shit they've done, as well as being raised republican, but you could say the same about democrats.
Trump was the guy pushed by some states during the primary.
Which is what I was trying to address in my argument.
As far as I know, it's not like there was a long a storied tradition of bipartisanship cooperation that Obama destroyed that day.
What this shows is that Republicans don't actually care about any of the things they claim to represent.
While your argument about the assumption of objectivity does hold some merit.
> Anything to avoid even criticising other Republicans.
I understand your point about what I said being theoretical in nature, but there's just about 50% of people in your country who like the Republicans more.
Assuming the differences we're talking about do NOT involve wholesale excluding someone from the protections of US law based on race/religion/sexual preference THEN the statement that Dems are morally superior to the GOP implies members of one group are inherently superior to those of another.
It's worthless.
My entire argument is based on the behavior of the two parties and how they DO politics, regardless of what those policies are.
>Republicans haven't had any actual policies that they're trying to put into place to improve people's lives.
What a crazy thing to say.
Not objective.
I don't believe any of my statements were incorrect, maybe generalizing since not everybody in either party thinks the exact same way but I was trying to go for the overall consensus among them.
So not even taking into consideration the actual ideas or talking points being presented on either side.
>Democrats are objectively better because they don't go back on their word and campaign the way politicians are ideally supposed to.
But they have been convinced that Democrats are all stupid and incompetent due to the repeated slander.
They claim that Democrats are eating their own tail because they will attack their own party members.
It is based on your perceptions of their behaviour, perceptions that may be (and are) seen differently by other people.
And most of the people who vote Republican do so because they believe in the slander, many of them have no idea what their party can do to actually help the country, because they rarely propose any ideas.
For the past 5-6 years, possibly longer but that's how long I've been paying attention to politics and can't say anything before then with certainty.
Another thing I've seen often in the Republican party is that Republicans play teams in politics while Democrats actually care about the values and morals they claim to fight for.
> Republicans play teams in politics while Democrats actually care about the values and morals they claim to fight for.
>A party that actually cares about the things they claim to advocate for would keep their morals and disavow the politician
I want to begin this by being explicitly clear that this argument has nothing to do with the policies behind either party.
It is an aesthetic value like "that painting is beautiful".
> And most of the people who vote Republican do so because they believe in  the slander, many of them have no idea what their party can do to  actually help the country, because they rarely propose any ideas.
and the opposite is subjective which means based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions.
Anything to avoid even criticising other Republicans.
While Republicans don't care about the character of any of their politicians and they are just playing the team game.

Ultimately, I think you have learned just enough about this disease to be grossed out by it, but not enough where you don't think it's a big deal.
Plus, what if they were adopted and don't know where they were born?
Also, why do you keep telling people you've been exposed?
There's a chance that viruses work the same way.
In other places, I think it depends on what people expect as the default.
Basically, you most likely have and had HSV-1 before this incident with this girl...if you kiss someone with an active outbreak, you got it, it's quite contagious during an outbreak.
They just eat a little bit of the food we eat, make vitamin K for us, and just hang out in our gut.
Considering that many other viruses cause death, a minor cosmetic issue in a minority of the population isn't a big deal.
The exact same thing applies to HSV-1.
Someone disclosing to you they have oral herpes doesn't statistically change or lessen your chances of getting it—unless moving forward you wait 3-4 months before kissing and make all of your prospective partners get blood tested for hsv1 before engaging in any physical activity.
As a final point, there are 8 different herpes viruses.
Herpes is almost as widespread and just as harmless in the form most people have.
Jesus Christ dude, what's wrong with being honest about it?
That's the thing though, I fully disclose so to all women before I get intimate with my 
I guarantee that there is some form of human herpesvirus living in your body right now.
And an unlikely few have sporadic outbreaks throughout their life, but they are the minority.
If it affects the other person, then they have the right to know.
That's why people who have gotten the chickenpox can get shingles when they are older.
Most of the people I know get cold sores and they never disclose and this will continue to be the norm indefinitely.
I'd even go as far as saying it'd biological assault.
I'd like to hear what you guys have to say about this.
Is it their fault?
We accept HSV-1 in the same way we accept the fact that there are more bacteria in our bodies than human cells.
3) even though I showed no symptoms and never had a cold sore on my lip or breakout near my genital  area in my life, I still may have the virus and it may be dormant and I could still be a carrier as well as possibly transmit it to them (even though I'm very certain I don't have it) 
Now scientists and regular people are excited about the prospect of treating diabetes and cancer with poop transplants.
Other bacteria live in our mouth, on our skin, on/in our genitals, etc.
There are many reddit posts about this too.
I can't fault them for not knowing one way or another.
Most people have an outbreak only when they first contract it and then never again.
I don't get how you can disagree with this and make such stupid points as to why.
Literally all of my closest friends have oral herpes and none of them have ever disclosed.
It is the norm, and it is not going to change just because of some random post with 9 upvotes on reddit🤷🏾‍♀️.
But it's transferred by saliva.
This idea is broadly called the [human microbiome.
That is a case of a person specifically asking someone if they'd had cold sores and the person lied about it.
as part of what it means to be alive.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfNPYolYC50)
For this reason lots of little kids have it.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome) Here's a [South Park clip about it.
There may be a chance I have it and I'm asymptomatic yet still a carrier, there also may be a huge chance I don't.
4) I don't care that tests aren't that reliable for it and sometimes they show false negatives (this is for those who do indeed know because they've had symptoms and sores) 
I've almost certain I don't have it yet I still disclose how I was exposed and may be a carrier.
I wasn't arguing whether I have it or not, I was simply stating that one should be honest about it before engaging in anything intimate with someone.
Personal deal breaker?
With something as common AND as grossly misunderstood as hsv1, the onus lies on the people who not only don't have hsv1 but also who strongly don't want to contract it.
2) I don't care if most people already have it but show no symptoms/the virus is dormant.
The only way you don't get it is if you die young before you have a chance to get it.
That's not the point though.
If a neutral bacteria doesn't help us, at least it can take up space so bad bacteria can't move in.
For example, in Turkey, where the [infection rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_herpes_simplex) is 97%, or in Peru where it's 92%, there's clearly no need to disclose because you can safely assume that anyone you come in contact with will have HSV1.
I agree though as far as reliability and trim is concerned all 3 American brands are the same now so it just comes down to preference
In the ACSI poll, 30 brands were reviewed.
Lol @ having to drive a bmw just to impress people or get them to like you.
Weird.
In particular, Consumer Reports listed the top 10 worst car brands, and 5 of them were Fiat Chrysler brands.
I'm mainly comparing older big block v8s like the 440 and stuff 
I've known people who needed tranny rebuilds due to not getting the check valve delete done on their 2nd gen with the 46re but other than that 2nd gens are just as solid as long as you don't live in the rust belt.
By "in the US" I mean sold in the US (both to account for the fact that Fiat bought Chrysler and that the polls compared Fiat Chrysler to cars from the US, Japan, Korea, Germany, etc.)
Chevy is decent but I wouldn't put them on par with dodge.
Rugged good looks on both the muscle cars and the trucks and are the best preforming v8s with the sickest exhaust note.
Dodge is fukkin' gay like seriously they have the logo of a fucking goat because appearantly Dodge drivers like to get rammed up their asshole by some billy ass goat like seriously mate , drive a BMW or get the fuck out of my country.
Also, the article I linked references some old polls.
What's so special about ford ?
Then why you're on Reddit looking for affirmation about your choice of cars ?
But if you care about things like reliability, price, quality, reputation, value retention, safety innovation, etc.
They invented and trademarked the phrase "Corinthian Leather" to make their leather sound good.
I drive what the fuck I want no fucks given.
Everyone I've known with dodge trucks has never had problems with anything major or expensive 3rd gen and up.
The answer is always no 
So Chrysler has a few things going for it.
Ever.
Yet ford has the best selling pickup in USA.
Fca is shit no doubt but their actual quality and top of the line vehicles like the ram , Cherokee srt/ trail hawk, challenger are all quality vehicles 
The only people I see driving f150s are pasty office workers in suits ( no hate ) who are scared to even hop a curb to park in a tight space.
Both companies at this point sell barely distinguishable lifestyle products.
Fiat came in at 26, Dodge came in at 28, and Chrysler came in dead last.
95 % junk 5% top of the line performance if you want a v8 
I like Nothing other than their lightweight 5.0.
When the transmission goes out on a ram or a newer Jeep the first thing I ask is if they read the user manual 
Smh 
How is this ?
[According to three different polls ](https://www.rd.com/culture/car-brand-worst-reputation/
Saying one "pisses over" the other is about as silly as claiming that Prada grabs Gucci's hair and pulls.
Dodge has everything you would expect out of a American v8.
The only real problems I see with the above mentioned products is when people don't read the owners manual 
They paid a bunch of TV shows for product placement for their cars (e.g., Archer, Breaking Bad).
Did you get the bands adjusted to keep the shifts smooth and save a ton of life on your transmission ?
The diesel trucks are where the bigger differences lie in reliability but they all trade blows with each other
For example, in the latest ASCI poll, Dodge dropped from 28 to 29 out of 30.
Did you change the filter and fluid at the recommended interval ?
The light duty trucks until recently had a very feminine ugly look to them , nobody cares you drive a mustang gt, it's an ugly overrated car with no character.
The 2nd gen ram  Haynes manual even explains the check valve problem and explains that it burns up the electronic shift solenoid in the 46re
They invented the term "Hemi" to describe their engines.
then Fiat Chrysler is at the absolute bottom.
When I think of a tough , high performance American brand v8 anything I think of dodge ...... not ford
Yet people still got duped in to a new stock tranny from the dealershit 🤦‍♂️
What's so special about them ?
There must be something I'm missing ?
The Rams and jeeps you can beat the shit out of and they won't stay down.
)(Axios Harris, Consumer Reports, and the American Consumer Satisfaction Index), Fiat Chrysler is "least reputable", the "worst," and the "least satisfying" car company in the US.
It may be used as a form of transition, but not necessary by any means.

"but there is a definite skill gap perhaps they are both DJ's but the crossfade DJ is a bad DJ and a scratching DJ is a good DJ the same way that a guitarist that has played for a month and can only play smoke on the water, smells like teen spirit and seven nation army is a bad guitarist and a guitarist who can play psychosocial is a good guitarist "
It was a joke.
I love hard trance and too much of that sort of stuff wouldn't go down well in the clubs I like to go to.
Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended.
you can feel free to hire who you want for your wedding.
A good deejay will not want a song to fade, but to seamlessly transition to the next song at the same (or closely matched) BPM.
Yes, people with a wider variety of skills can be considered better than people with only a subset of those same skills.
Are you still a guitarist if you can't or don't sweep pick?

Building and maintaining the emotion in a room.
My mind has been changed since then
Any time someone tells they are a DJ my first question is "do you know how to scratch" because I think scratching is fucking sick but 99% of the time they say no which leaves me with a feeling of disappointment.
Yeah I guess you are right but I still don't think DJ's should be all high and mighty about their skill when it's just picking the right songs to play.
For instance, image the transition between Brick House to Get Down Tonight.
So your next track is Get Down Tonight, but it has a 15 second intro that does not have a driving beat.
Granted these are really vital techniques to be great, but not knowing or using a skill, doesn't make you less of a musician.
Occasionally, they'll completely remix several songs together digitally which is similar to what some DJs do with multiple turntables.
Scratching is turntablism.
I was a deejay for a long time, but burned out and gave it up.
A good deejay will put on the headphones and que up the next track track so that the beats match and you don't hear the fade of Brick House or the 15 second intro to Get Down Tonight.
i made a similar point above i have changed my and i agree they are both DJ's but one is more skilled than the other below is my comment for context  
but learning how to scratch over a drumbeat/instrumental or cool parts you can improve over a premade song requires practice a good ear and talent that is a DJ a Spotify user is not.
Lean the skills you need.
fuck i just wooshed my self
That's like saying, "you're not a guitarist unless you can shred to black metal"
you have changed my mind but I still think that there are conventions of being a DJ (announcing, scratching, crossfades ETC) which make a great DJ if you can just do one or two really well then you are good but not great the same way guitar playing has conventions (arpeggios, tremolo picking, knowing the shapes of scales and keys ETC) and doing one or two really well can make you good but not great mastering a holistic approach to both of these makes great musicians.
now someone has already changed my view on my topic but my issue with DJs acting all high and mighty remains
DJing is about matching beats and mood.

Most songs played at a wedding wouldn't be well received with scratching or any other kind of modification.
Throwing in the whoops and hollers from one song while another is playing is an artform, first attempted on vinyl, but then extrapolated to all sorts of deejay forms where  crossfader can be used.
Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/amus ([1∆](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/amus)).
What if your actual name is dj?
Not only is that one example of not using raw tracks, but with a fader, you can literally mix two songs together, or just parts of them.
So, without knowing exactly *what deejays really do*, you can't really say that you know what is or isn't a "real" deejay

would you know if this is true?
But I was only looking at large scale industries.
That's on me.
For example, if I think that meat eating is wrong for animal cruelty reasons, but I still do it because changing habit is hard, while fully acknowledging that what I am doing is wrong.
And by extension "they don't need animal fur/ skin to live" is also cancelled.
You can for sure voice out concern.
)" behind their words.
Hence I mentioned if a person has significantly  reduced meat consumption to a level that is minimal/ just enough for healthy living.
Male chicks are Still killed minutes to hours after hatching since they are useless.
Disclaimer: I am not vegan/ vegetarian 
Many people have talked about countless issues (this one included) and no real change has happened.
But if you are a meat eater - pork/ beef/ lamb/ chicken, the meat industry is so so so cruel to all its animals, 0 question there.
If you're saying "we need meat to survive" this has been proven untrue (if it's health reasons and a person has significantly reduced meat intake to bare minimum I would classify them in the non-meat eater category but they're also not the average person).
1.
I agree that they have a point.
Wouldn't it be better if at least people talk about it?
Or are we raising it for food, or scientific research, or to make clothing out of?
answering on behalf of a typical meat eater)
Pls CMV.
I feel there's no need to qualify it more than "typical person" once again many will bring in special requirements etc
And if they did, I'm sure they wouldn't be in favor of it.
Personally I would just tax the living shit out of the bio industry and use that money to make free range and meat replacements cheaper.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Think about this problem in general.
I don't think it's hypocritical to eat meat.
petitioning against meat eating and not eating meat/ buying from organic products instead.
But that's a legal technicality.
Can you argue for something passionately when you are a non-believer.
If I decided to grand stand and make a big stink, tell everyone why I'm not eating meat anymore I'd only be screwing myself.
Agreed.
He does have a point.
I think there is a distinction between meat and fur because maybe it's a location dependent thing but everywhere I've lived it's cheaper and easier to have a healthier diet with some meat than no meat.
But it's expensive and time consuming, and I was raised as a meat eater.
As someone else said people being critical of the market and wanting change is a good thing 
Case in point: this very post.
Raised, or a vegetarian all together.
!
IF that is your concern then your essentielly wanting People to change a view wich is a lager beneath your view.
Is different.
For the meat industry I feel the increase in cost would severely impact loads of people, lower income (?)
For witnessing of pet abuse, if you yourself do not partake in it in any form.
If a person has a problem with animal abuse and eats meat they are hypocrites since they are actively contributing to the thing they say is bad.
Regards, the mods of /r/changemyview.
Im a little unclear on your specific claim of hypocrisy here.
Like leather items etc 
If I talk about meat industry being horrible but continue eating meat... is this really doing anything?
I do feel that a hypocrite has less moral authority and less "clout(?
What's hypocritical is to force farmers to sell their land if they don't cooperate with corporations or for laws to pass that force farmers to sell their land because there's no way they can compete with factory farming.
What a disturbing category of materialism).
They can't still be morally hypocritical, they just arent aware.
Regardless, it is a fascinating and morbid concept.

it's actually unlikely that much alcohol would make it to your gut and be digested the way solids are, since it's absorbed into your bloodstream way before that.
They also say that there is not enough oxygen in the gut to sustain a flame, and it would go out as soon as it forms, so there would be no explosion per se.
I mean I don't want it to be non spontaneous and non internal.

I can see how alcohol could potentially be a culprit as I remember reading about a case where flames came from an alcoholic man's gut but I wasn't sure if that was legit or not because normally alcohol doesn't ignite spontaneously.
I feel kind of bummed out because like I said this phenomenon fascinated me (morbid I know) and I want it to be a real thing.
I remember being fascinated with this as a kid and I want to believe.
I wouldn't take a small article from a media known for exagerating "evidence" as long as it gave them views and replacing actual scientific fields with pseudoscience (Ancient Aliens, for example) as scientific proof that something that seems impossible is actually possible.

I want evidence your gut could spontaneously combust and set your body on fire even if you were say, lying in bed naked with no clothes, no static electricity, no ignition sources nearby, no cigarettes, etc.
I've learned about spontaneous combustion as a student of the Victorian period, and there are definitely ways that people can randomly catch fire and die that have nothing to do with smoking cigarettes or the amount of oxygen in the body, but I want to know if you actually want the mystery solved or not
Pretty much all the eye witness cases involve a flame bursting from the gut area.

You're welcome!
The length of your comment suggests that you haven't properly explained how /u/blk_sabbath changed your view (comment rule 4).
DeltaBot is able to rescan edited comments.
But my belief is that market values are not just a response to a correct view of reduced risk (e.g.
But negative rates, while possible are a bad idea and unlikely to be continued as a permanent policy.
It will remain sustainable until there is no more wealth to be extracted.
You've lost a few pennies a share, but a normal investor has lost twice that much.
Of course it could also all go to shit like Black Monday 1987 or 2008, there is no guarantee.
But I don't understand why high speed trading would impact liquidity.
Globalization has put tractors in farmers hands so their productivity has doubled from 1 unit to 2.
Yes, the first part was just an illustration of the power and huge impact of computerized trading.
2) There are the Fed banks, large mutual/pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and the larger banking system which have a number of macro- and microeconomic interventions to prevent outright collapse and buoy up the market.
The person that is most likely to invent the robot is a large corporation (or a small startup that becomes a large corporation).
With Self driving cars and AI on the horizon, I don't think so.
To clarify the first point, the changes that had large, positive impacts to valuation are not repeatable because they are one-time in nature or have reached a natural limit.
the Greenspan Put as a permanent policy) but that the increase in money from central banks globally has increased over this era.
There is a significant amount of resources that used to be unavailable due to a water layer.
And there is lot of evidence that it goes back WAY before the 1900s.
a company with good financials might not lose value in a way which is consistent with our view of how the market should operate.
Which then completes the transaction.
This could be a one-time event with an upward impact on market values that would not continue.
Dude, don't fight it.
They have huge amounts of algo trading, but focused on maintaining the status quo.
People have been in your shoes for 100+ years.
But there isn't another globalization that can happen.
There are various reasons to believe the US is due for a pretty good recession.
Before, a farmer could grow 1 unit of food on 1 acre of land.
You can (with about $100,000 because algo trading only works with large amounts of money) write this script yourself and make money.
Even just coordinating the 43 countries that supply the parts to make the iPhone is a challenge in itself.
Also, most retirement planners do advise you to be conservative and not use the past 20 years as a guide and build in some safety cushion but, at some point, there is only so much you can do.
Liquidity verses volume (which is the number of trades that day).
The person who invents the robot is going to become extremely rich.
Well, first of all, if you are starting you analysis in 1980 you are absolutely doing poor analysis.
So investing in that year is absolutely going to produce above average returns.
not likely.
I agree with your second paragraph.
The market expansion is not merely due to recession busting tools, but, in part, to bubble-inflation tools.
Or worse selling at market prices, which can lose actual percentage points of value over the deals which banks make among themselves.
But large banks, sovereign wealth funds and central banks might be using computers to keep everything going up.
Those purchases prevent the stock from losing too much value, which the brokerage now owns.
Another way this argument is often phrased is, "The US has used up all of its recession busting tools and, unless I raises interest rates, the next recession could be a bad one".
Changes such as these explain overall increase in stock valuations.
In a few months people forget about the grandmas dying and company A releases a new quarterly report which looks great.
That is, the Greenspan Put went global.
The prevailing approach to investing in the stock market in the US is that while performance of the market in a given year is variable, taking average performance over a period of time is a reasonable predictor of future performance.
My argument is that we should not expect market returns to outstrip it, as it has in the past, due to government supports for increasing valuations.
Are you talking historical performance or enormous gains?
The only issue is that while some farmers have adopted all the tools, most people aren't using them yet.
Stonks go up.
So, these algos are really fast and have very 'granular' views of the trading environment (they can see individual trades essentially).
So when the price drops, and as the NYSE starts to display this activity, they begin buying.
TL;DR The computer trading revolution might be buying stocks faster than the market can push their value down.
Especially with interbank lending rates so low, the large players might be able to push back even a few days of really bad losses to prevent a real 'collapse.'
`There aren't other jobs for unskilled labor.`
This is how labor evolves, people are treated unfairly by their employer (wether that be real or imagined) and then fight to improve that treatment.
* Pay rent
My thought perspective is this.
This would be true if the job existed in a vacuum.
Just because something is the best option doesn't mean its good or fair.
Labor gets concessions by making businesses hurt or embarrassed.
If they hate the job so vehemently, what's preventing employees from quitting and finding a different job?
If Amazon was the only employer with  employees calling for change but no escape, I have no doubt that Amazon would continue to overwork their employees.
This goes back to the idea that if employees hated working in the warehouse, they could just leave (which they did).
Workers complain that its ruining their lives and some are living out of their cars.
All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed [here](/r/DeltaLog/comments/euisps/deltas_awarded_in_cmv_amazon_warehouse_workers/), in /r/DeltaLog.
So you should accept it without complaint and die?
If I ever had unreasonable quotas and my employer didn't change, I would quit.
Amazon has improved working conditions and pay in a lot of ways over the past 5 years.
My premises are:
Your view is that basically no employee ever has grounds to complain because they can just quit and find another job.
This doesn't include the time you will also be needing for interviews, which may be difficult to get if your current job is not accommodating to personal time.
Otherwise, they would have just kept their old jobs.
I want to focus on this point.
4) Given 1-3, people must be working in order to survive.
Now, there's x less jobs available, and that many hypothetical families will starve.
Blue collar workers are in high demand.
Just because the working conditions are better than competitors doesn't mean they can't be better.
If you think Amazon made these changes based on the complaints, then you consider Amazon a kinder company than I do.
They don't have enough money or time.
If you decide to get a job, and Amazon offers the best wage/work conditions why should you then complain about them?
Maybe they shouldn't be forced by circumstances into doing unsafe things.
a) People who were employed at the current town or neighboring towns.
A few complaining workers doesn't threaten that.
The gains that have been achieved so far are largely the direct result of the sort of action you're criticizing here.
^[Delta System Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)
2) Food, water, and shelter (and healthcare in the USA) are exclusively acquired in our society through the exchange of money.
This is going to sound unforgiving, but as I mentioned, having high quotas is exchange for high wages and the best employment option makes sense to me.
After all you could always quit and probably end up homeless and starving.
Therefore, there will ALWAYS be someone willing to work whatever job is offered.
Amazon didn't put their minimum wage to 15/hr because they were kind but because they needed to compete with other employers.
Especially given the lag in paychecks, you could start a new job and be without a paycheck for an extra few weeks.
After all, its clearly their best option or they would choose death instead.
People who are currently working at Amazon but dislike their employment come from two groups:
Third, complaining is the first step in recognizing a problem.
My job is better than working at McDonald's, but how do I complain on behalf of a McDonald's worker?
I sympathize with this group since they are left with no good options, but it seems like they are biting the hand that feeds them.
If I ever had unreasonable quotas and my employer didn't change, I would quit.
It's all part of the same environment.
Something can still be the best option available, but also be bad.
They don't want their families to starve and there aren't other jobs for unskilled labors.
Working conditions at Amazon can be both inhumane and the best option available, and being the latter doesn't make them immune to criticism on the former.
In a lesser note, if you vote for someone on a promise and he wins the office, you lose the right to complain about the promise when he attempts to pursue it.
People should have decent working conditions.
I don't earnestly know what other conversation you think we've been having.
That's an argument, again, from preference.
Animals haven't tripled their 'natural' lifespan.
Because that's the whole point of life.
Since the continued life of humans means more technological and scientific advances for extending a human's lifespan, it's good to have them alive.
Just like some companies can treat cows and pigs so badly that it affects the meat and makes people sick.
It is of no interest to me whether animals help you with those things and humans don't, and you have made no argument as to why it should matter.
Ultimately, linking personhood to ability creates problems when that ability is non-essential to the human having that ability.
Premise 2: your argument for your claim rests on your idea of the meaning of life.
[See the wiki page for more information](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5).
We are depleting our resources faster than we can manage.
Animals shouldn't need a right to vote or anything absurd like that but humans shouldn't abuse their power beat $5 puppies to death because we don't beat up $5 babies to death despite babies and puppies being extremely similar from one another.
I don't like them.
So would nearly all people I know.
They can't (significantly) learn, can't change and can't do anything that I call progress.
And if not, why not?
That said I don't exactly remember that tangent so I'm going to move to your third paragraph.
True, some are smarter than others, but they are all still woefully idiotic.
So the benefit to society is: not feeling sad/bad that those poor animals are suffering unnecessarily.
The arguments you've made that it's not ok to brutally murder humans while it *is* ok to brutally murder animals (which is the presumption my hypothetical worked with) are based on preference of outcome, which I have argued is not compelling.
Why do you feel it makes a difference?
Not now that we're using it all.
>They have the same resources we had.
> Ah, gotcha.
I accept that we justify the suffering of factory farms because we need/want/enjoy cheap meat to eat.
I have tons of faith sciences ability to get us off this planet but little faith in my felow man; because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't need a second planet.
They didn't learn that: it was instinctive.
This entire view either relies on the direct influence of a divine guide or some sort of vague notion that evolution has an end goal... ie, things evolve towards something.
This is generally counter-intuitive with how we'd define personhood.
Animals are still tools for humans to feel better about themselves.
I look at it like this all animals are thinking beings, they live and they have a brain as we do.
While that may still be the case, I personally see it as that the direction this conversation is going in is one regarding whether animals deserve rights or not.
The point of life is expansion because through expansion we can bring purpose to land and rocks and plants and animals.
Animals feel the need to survive, despite how people treat them.
Your meaning of life makes sense to you, mine makes sense to me.
And we , as humans, see causing pain as wrong.
Sorry, u/Goodnamebro – your comment has been removed for breaking Rule 5: 
Animals' inability to reach one milestone doesn't exempt them from failing to reach any others.
Also.. there were animals before humans... What was their "purpose" ?
Gunpowder is universally good?
>(which is still in direct contradiction to OP)
What makes you sure we are not "waiting on someone to show up" to use us as a resource?
Anyway, I can say that animals don't deserve rights because they're useful to humans, and them having rights would make them less useful to us for no clear benefit.

Seems like to me, in order to hold this position, you need to come up with an answer to the classic "Name the trait" argument, namely:
At which point did we pass the line and gain worth in your eyes?
Animals use tools, grieve lost love ones, build structures to changes their environment, communicate with each other over vast distances, plan long term...animals exist to serve humans no more than a zebra exist to serve a lion.
No one can be reduced to one statement.
Not you, not me, and not celebrities either.
Ex:Tiger Woods, still gets praised for his success) Yes he may have done all these pretty horrible things, he was mostly a great role model because of just how hard he worked at basketball with a work ethic that was second to none that inspired so many people to work as hard as they could basically, and was definitely more of a family man towards the end of his career as well as in retirement.
The Khmer Rouge swung infants against tree trunks.
Rather, your are simply focusing on the good rather than the bad.
Michael Jackson... well you know.
Others are allowed more nuanced views.
but he was a rapist.
The specifics are not known.
Yes people can feel however they want about his death, but how is the equivalency not relevant?
He was initially presumed to be guilty by public opinion.
> **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP's stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.
Ok that's an extreme example but it's the same point.
3.
Kobe's family have every right to express their grief.
I can't see it as a "mistake" because I think that you HAVE to be evil to rape someone.
Settlements **do not admit to any wrong doing.
People like you are perpetrators of victim shaming.
You clearly are in the faction of our society who has celebrity's dicks gobbled so far down your throat that you've taken up the task of defending their honor as human beings.
He's also being rightly recognized for the bad things he did (or allegedly did; no comment on that as I don't know the specifics).
He got plenty of attention and wasn't even the best by any means.
He was a rapist who was amazing at basketball.
It seems like professional athletes, as a population, have an inordinate amount of dudes suspected of sexual violence at some point in their lives.
After practicing, he drove his daughters to school  because he valued seeing his daughters every morning.
Though I've been told no both verbally and nonverbally and always clearly provided a nonverbal opportunity to withdraw or continue.
He literally just died today I don't think it's all praise I think it's more "I looked up to him, it's sad to see his death"  I'm not excusing a pos behaviour of him if those articles show truth, either that's unacceptable for what he did.
(Also this idea has been on my mind as I recently watched the documentary about Aaron Hernandez, in which they painted him as that typical douchebag-bully star-athlete who takes the cliche of "star athlete can do anything they want" to it's demented extreme by flippantly murdering people for no reason and barely trying to conceal it.
So, please CMV.
Basically a confession from Kobe.
4.6 out of every THOUSAND rapists are incarcerated.
I agree with the OP, he simply doesn't deserve the massive outpouring of sympathy.
Being raped will cause you trauma, and having to see the entire world mourn your rapist calling him a wonderful person despite what he did to you will surely make you remember that trauma and make you feel as if what he did to you doesn't matter because he did a lot of good too.
[removed]
I lost brain cells reading this.
Ok so feeling sad because someone you never personally knew but looked up to died and feeling absolutely horrified because everyone in the world sympathyses with someone who made the choice to rape you are equivalent?
Arguments in favor of the view OP is willing to change must be restricted to replies to other comments.
Humor and affirmations of agreement can be contained within more substantial comments.
Telling them to "get the fuck over themselves" isn't helpful.
"art" in its loosest definition definitely includes sports and athletic performance.
> "[The nurse] stated that there were several lacerations to the victim's posterior fourchette or vaginal area, and two of those lacerations were approximately one centimeter in length," testified Det.
To commit manslaughter, you do not have to be evil, but the calculated planning of third degree murder requires evil.
Which Kobe was consistently giving back and has done countless amounts of charity events, im pretty sure he has a foundation so the guy was also very well respected for good reason and many more than what I mentioned
doesn't take into account that it happened 17 years ago when he was like 24 years old.

Going back to your original comment:
That is not in anyway an admission of guilt.
It's important to be clear what you're criticising.
But raping a woman?
Please note that multiple violations will lead to a ban, as explained in our [moderation standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modstandards).
so yeah.
They can move away from socialism and free up their economy to improve their own technology.
That whole concept doesn't make sense if you're dealing with all pale faced motherfuckers... (ignoring for a second that there probably also have been people of color in Europe and that this racism has also been around, but not really been the real theme of history) It's only in Apartheid states like the U.S. where you already had a concept of second class citizenship through "whiteness" where you could deny pale faced people equal rights by arguing about whiteness.
It's about making  people care about their race.
>Sure Germany didn't actually conquer anything, but many components of fascist thinking go far beyond their borders.
Well, that is just not true:
If you think this trend is true for liberalism but not fascism, note it took about 110 years after defeat (1815-1925) for liberalism to truly peak, and fascism was only defeated 75 years ago.
Military and the battles they fight are detached from the ideas.
That kind of shit actually permeates through war as if your dealing with someone who doesn't just want to win but to subjugate and exterminate you're kind of copying that or it's easier to do so.
> but as an ideology they only grew stronger since then.
Don't confuse your American racism with the classical European Chauvinism.
"Blackpeopletwitter".
The Fascists believed human beings were naturally wired to form social hierarchies and mass groups that guaranteed strength and unstoppable will.
Sure, France hasn't conquered anything since Waterloo, but liberalism went beyond France.
Both liberalism and fascism are complex ideologies I admit, but here I'm going to use them broadly and say Liberalism was born in the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars were partly a war of liberals vs conservatives.
Militarily most fascists were beaten in 1945 like most liberals in 1815, but as an ideology they only grew stronger since then.
You can have a "liberal dictatorship" or a 'liberal Empire' in my opinion.
>*Benito Mussolini*
Those ideas stuck around for other reasons, not because one nation forced them upon another via war.
Not really, fascism is about about the chauvinims of an ingroup vs an outgroup, with some religious undertones of rebirth and in terms of the Nazis and followups of a destruction theory.
America) would willingly adopt either a Monarchy or a Fascist system.
Mussolini was the ideological fascist at the time.
They've always been there.
Stuff like that?
>Ultimately I have to disagree with your edit you made.
That with Austria, Germany and Switzerland there are even 3 countries with German as one of if not their official language and whatnot.
Europe might not be united, but the EU continues to question that reality.
Fascism isn't really an "ideology" in the first place.
Look at the size of Europe and how many fucking countries exist within that space.
There was no such idea that all whites were racially superior Aryans.
Most of these countries had decades if not century long wars and non of them was concerned with "being white".
It went through a major recession for an extended period of time but never remotely considered abolishing democracy.
'That's such a white girl thing'.
The sticking power of ideologies is to do with the prosperity, power, benefits etc they afford, not how big someones army is.
I don't know if we'll ever say Hitler was actually the good guy in WW2 because of the war and the Holocaust, but fascist may be to jacobin as Nazi is to white identatrian.
This also totally failed.
We are constantly seeing new technology and for the most part democracy is in good shape.
Fascism is no more about world conquest that Napoleonic liberalism is.
We've seen it succeed after military defeat.
Currently, Capitalism is not decadent.
Several leading fascists were themselves jews, as for example Moussolinis longtime lover.
It ruled in Germany and Italy, held sway over a number of smaller countries, and had a number of authoritarian allies such as Japan who didn't embrace fascism but were fairly close in a number of ideological ways.
>If you think this trend is true for liberalism but not fascism, note it took about 110 years after defeat (1815-1925) for liberalism to truly peak, and fascism was only defeated 75 years ago.
Also racism existed way before the Italian fascists...
We are currently seeing something similar to that in America with Sander's Democratic Socialists.
Sure Germany didn't actually conquer anything, but many components of fascist thinking go far beyond their borders.
I think people just aren't aware how Marxist theory works.
Nazi Germany in particular wanted to rid the world of "undesirable" people, which they ultimately failed.
all "whites" are the same.
>Race is now a central component of every political and cultural discussion, and a mixed economy model is very widespread.
Liberalism was not exactly riding high in 1880, 75 years after its military defeat.
I was speaking kind of metaphorically.
He's a terrible person that needs to go to jail, my friend says Trump's a godsend,  but we both agree that our friendship is worth more than whatever fox news or CNN are selling us in-between the outrage of playing both sides against each other for profit.
Yes, we would debate his legacy, but if pence were sworn in and brought some level of stability and a return to respecting presidential norms, that would alleviate a lot of the existential threat that Trump is posing to the future of our democracy right now, with this entire impeachment debacle.
Everyone is both good and bad, I'm jaded as fuck I I will admit to being on the darker end of the 'shades of gray' spectrum.
If they support the status quo, then the status quo will be what continues.
You know how we always hear how the government doesn't care about the average person, etc.
Yeah, definitely the first thing I thought about as well.
Yeah you're too far left.
They'll have police, military, all institutions, whoever protecting them.
Maybe 8-12 years from now, they need time for Trump's legacy to cement, and also don't want to contribute to someone picking up on his administration's momentum.
Report other violations; do not retaliate.
That's literally what the whole impeachment is all about.
That the current American political situation would become more polarized if Trump suddenly died (I assume of natural causes)?
Yeah, not right away.
is one of the highest -and you all know it!
They would look downright hypocritical if they immediately went back on their comments.
Trump is using the power of presidency and foreign policy to leverage aid in elections from foreign powers.
90% of politicians are hyper rich and exist in a whole other world compared to the rest of people.

"Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q.
What on earth are people going to quote from trump that doesn't make him look heinous?
ohh, so you are the person who is glad.
Debates are already heated and people are already taking sides with vigor.
I'm not sure they would.
They'll just see where they can draw comparisons.
Given some time away, they'll talk about his legacy, and how x Republican is lackluster compared to his legacy, much like they do with Reagan nowadays, or even Bush.
That's HIS fault, not ours.
We don't matter at all to them.
He's a textbook con-man; if you live your life badly nobody is sad when it ends.
All that will happen is fighting on social media and the media spinning things for their own profit and sensationalist clicks.
An establishment Republican would be president, the impeachment would be over.
?
Like, he's the victim here, so he's obviously not a racist and that immigrants and minorities should team up with Trump against the "racist white males."
This is certainly a thing, but not every republican is good material for it.
Doesn't really deserved to be compared to "Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall".
Pence would take over, and he would probably not do much until election.
The fact that the left would openly celebrate Trump's passing would, as the OP argues, divide us further.
Him dying would disrupt the status quo in such a severe way as to, in my opinion, resemble a power vacuum in mainstream political discourse.
Adam Schiff's [closing remarks](https://youtu.be/ecpF26eMV3U) summarize it pretty well.
Taking a forgiving stance on his presidency and adopting a conciliatory strategy would probably work a lot better than being confrontational.
People on the left are threatening civil unrest if trump is re elected, I think that more of a threat.
[See the wiki page for more information](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_2).
First it was slavery and the similar, and now it's right and left wing politics.
Then there would be old clips people would dig up of now 98 year old presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticizing Trump from 2018.
You don't see that as a problem for people on the right?
Bigger than JFK.
Please don't feel so stupid or insecure,it's not your fault"
All they have to do is to acknowledge that their grievances are real and to show how Dem solutions would help them.
There wouldn't be a republican nominee, if trump dies then pence becomes president.

Similarly, even if Muslim terrorism is more deadly on a "per capita" basis, I am much more likely to encounter a right wing terrorist than a Muslim terrorist, meaning that right wing terrorism is a greater threat to me.
This claims 80% of jihadists in the US are from the US https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/who-are-terrorists/ so each white right winger citizen has a .0000013% chance of being a terrorist and .0000062% chance.
One might also want to consider if it might not be more appropriate to compare sub-ideologies (eg: far-right versus muslim-fandamentalist) in answering this specific question.
Simply reducing it to the mere body count isn't sufficient here.
That's fair, but I also wouldn't be writing this if people weren't trying to use right wing terrorism stats to say something about the right.
My point was more that the cutoff date for the stats I cited was 9/12/2001... if we're going by that cutoff date then including incidents from the mid 1800s seems out of the question.
There are people on this very website who push the narrative that Islam is a demonic religion that makes all of them essentially sleeper terrorists, and that means we have to be extra careful about accuracy and telling a complete narrative.

\> [This](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/cnn-right-wingers-are-americas-deadliest-terrorists-if-you-exclude-9-11) would be one example of such.
If we look at it through that lens, suddenly its 8:1 odds on white terrorists committing more effective attacks...
And cheers!
My bad.
More comprehensive studies might extend this analysis by examining how targeted (eg: towards specific groups within America, or geographically across the US) the attacks are, how they vary across time, and what the variance of the death toll is.
So !delta.
Right wing, white-nationalist terrorism has an almost *infinitely greater chance* of actually achieving any of its goals.
Muslim terrorism in the United States and Europe creates shootings.
With regard to the hypothetical post about black people being shot by the police, the way that that hypothetical title is worded casts a vulnerable group as the victims, which is why I said that it would depend on the content of the post.
As for where I got the right wing numbers: Gallup.
>So would you object to a title like "on a per capita basis blacks are more likely to get shot by police" over a post that does a similar analysis for the absolute and relative numbers?
There are many things people don't believe to be possible until they happen, and I think fascism and far-right dictatorships are within this realm.
Which is still 5x more likely.
I also think it's a mistake to ignore the massive potential for damage that right wing extremists could do.
But in politics questions often get blurred, and the question which is often *implied* by such statistical discussions is: "Are muslims good people?".
Lynchings.
**Proportion of deadly coconuts:** 10/1,000,000,000 = **0.000000001**
What are your variables for determining such?
Point is, once you discount Pulse being the horrific outlier that it is, even your lens kinda falls apart.
Muslim terrorism just doesn't have these same ripple effects in the West.
We've seen Democratic Backsliding in America, and these fuckers obviously thought it was their time to shine because they organised the "Unite the Right" rally which of course ultimately contained a right wing terror attack against counter-protesters that killed one and injured 28.
I'm not sure if you're just defining them as white people who are registered Republicans (which doesn't seem like an ideal metric) or there's a different calculation going on here
I'm saying that there's a lot of white people in America, and "enough" of them commit terrorism that white right wing terrorism is a relatively large threat as far as terrorism goes.
You're saying that, by body count, a Muslim is more likely to have attacked you- despite the fact that the article you quote yourself points out that the body counts are massively skewed by the singular horrific death toll at Pulse here in my hometown.
**Proportion of deadly right-wingers:** 62/88,344,000 = **.00000007**
It's rightwing violence either way.
I've seen a lot of mainstream news outlets publishing things about how white right wingers are the greatest domestic terrorism threat, or how they committed all/most terrorism in a given year.
Nukes and gatling guns can kill a lot more people than pistols but which one are you more likely to be killed by?
If anything, Muslim domestic terrorism might be a threat *precisely because it can cause right-wing hyper-nationalism as a backlash*, in which case we're back to the latter being the greater threat, even if it's triggered out of the former.
If you want to say that neither right wing nor Islamic extremism say anything at all about the right wing or Muslim communities as a whole, I'm fine with that.
Basically "I think X argument is stupid" 
Just for an example, when trying to figure out which demographic suffers the most at the hands of the police you wouldnt use the raw, unadjusted numbers.
In short, it's because the ramifications of casting someone has a threat without a full picture is a little more serious than having someone as a victim without the full picture, in general.
This is why statistics is sometimes looked down upon by other mathematicians; it's not proof-based, which inherently invites subjectivity.
Freaking Nazi Germany.
If I asked whether Disney or Facebook made a larger profit last year, you wouldn't answer by telling me which one of them made more profit per employee.
A terrorist attack is horrific, but it doesn't ripple through the social fabric of potentially tens of millions of the dominant group in the country, and they don't start to actually consider implementing Shariah Law, or whether Hollywood should stop exporting movies to Muslim countries.
>That's why we can't ignore them or try and make the claim that people are more likely to the victims of terrorism by extremist Muslims.
If you were to factor in population disparities then Muslims are multitudes more likely to engage in terrorism than right wingers are.
If they're not, you can just point out that by their own metrics Muslims are a greater concern.
If you take out the two highest death toll events from both right wing terrorist attacks and Muslim terrorist attacks, you end up with right wing terrorists causing \*way\* more death than Muslim terrorism.
After how SARS spread so rapidly in East Asia and other parts of the world, it became a defining part of the 2000's the same way 9/11 was a part of the USA 2000's.
It is the fact that a lot of these factors are a huge unknown that we need to act with caution.
>2004: Avian influenza (H5N1), sometimes avian flu, and commonly bird flu
(around 0.02%) They think people are contagious without being symptomatic too.
And seemingly out of nowhere the whole continent was getting sick.
> If a disease like the flu were to mutate to be more deadly and at the same time mutate to have a longer incubation period
It has spread to about 2,000 people-- 2,000 *Chinese* people, which is maybe important to you.
Although yes, the old and already sick are the ones that are dying, that does not mean healthy people aren't at risk.
The common pattern among these epidemics is that despite all the uproar in the media and among politicians, these diseases never end up as dangerous as predicted.
Generally though, H5N1 is highly virulent and it's a big danger one.
We don't know if it has the capability to mutate as it sweeps through the human population.
But there is no reason for that to have been the case other than pure luck of the draw.
3) The average person with the flu does not die.
The H2N2 epidemic killed 1,000,000 people in 1968, including 15% of Hong Kong's population.
There was the Spanish flu back in 1918, but that was before modern sanitation standards emerged.
The other one is whether or not you've been exposed to those strains before.
 - 2014: Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa
Vaccine?
And from SARS we can see why the world is so worried, as the Wuhan virus seems to be following in the steps of SARS down to the dot.
Rather than simply looking at "death toll" we should be worried if the infection rate x mortality rate exceeds the common flu.
2) Rapidly spread throughout China and East Asia (although internationally, all have been imported cases and no known local transmissions yet) 
The biggest reason for the world to be concerned about the Wuhan virus is because of what it is.
Suffice to say, contagious disease is still a major threat to the human population, and its in large part due to modern medical science that we haven't been slammed by a trusty catastrophic pandemic.
1.
If you live in area where the virus is actually present then it's a different story.
Already in Wuhan, a healthy 36 y/o with no pre existing conditions has passed away.
Would you not consider HIV/AIDS a pandemic?
i.e.
Health experts worldwide have been simulating the apocalyptic outbreak.
It appears that something worse than the flu could indeed happen in modern times.
Finally, we have the HIV pandemic, which has a current death toll of around 36 million, making it one of the single most deadly disease outbreaks in human history.
This mortality rate is right now at 3% but likely to increase.
By the time you catch your first case it may be spread halfway around the world already.
If a disease like the flu were to mutate to be more deadly and at the same time mutate to have a longer incubation period... we're in a lot of trouble.
Long incubation period 
I would think this depends entirely on where you live.
Specific immunity has something to do with it, but I'm using the names to refer to the outbreaks.
 - 2015: Zika virus outbreak
Even at the 3%, its orders of magnitude greater (100 times greater now) fatality rate now than the flu.
> **Direct responses to a CMV post must challenge at least one aspect of OP's stated view (however minor), or ask a clarifying question**.
We don't know how rapidly it has spread.
Do you see a reason to worry about Hemmoragic Fever?
 - 1996: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad-cow disease

Their death toll is tiny compared to global deaths from regular flu and would basically go unnoticed if it wasn't for the global panic.
Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/SeasickSeal ([1∆](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/SeasickSeal)).
We are early into the outbreak and the cases have not had time to run the full course yet.
Nevermind my source for flu deaths was just for the US.
Even after 17 years, there is still no vaccine or cure for SARS.
>2009: Pandemic H1N1/09 Influenza
So we can either look at Nazi Germany and see that every time it took more territory it was not satisfied and continued to take more territory.
I do think that.
>But Canada has fought in the past because it knew if it didn't it would have to one day face a direct threat on its soil.
>Turns out, if left to their own devices, some people would kill us just to have us dead.
Title 10 of the USC severely limits the activities the US military can do domestically, and most of what it can do is boiled down to support for other state/federal agencies that DO operate domestically.
Replete natural resources, huge agricultural production capability, and geographically isolated...all very attractive prospects to potential foreign powers.
If anyone tried to send a nuke to America it would be blown up minutes after being launched, and it would only harm the country which sent it off.
What do you do to stop the cycle?
I'm just trying to understand the common rhetoric.
Just because Canada has not faced any extremely deadly threat does not mean it would or could happen without the joint effort of NATO and western allies.
You may not agree with that path, but it's none of our god damn business.
All you have ever known is the "liberal world order" established, and maintained by, the United States after WWII and therefore you think it's the norm.
Had there been no draft for Vietnam, I'm pretty sure we'd still be there.
And yet, he could do it anyway, thinking that it would make him a "war president"... he's about that stupid.
Overall I just the US was too powerful to be just left alone.
I'm looking for concrete examples of a power that intended or attempted to invade Canada, and was deterred by the military EDIT through direct conflict.
The soldiers dying were the ones who did sign up after all.
There were limits event to that which Nazi Germany wanted.
So no, if Trump tried to enact some draconian martial law, the chances of the military complying is lower than you seem to believe.
Okay, at what point would you interfere again?
Altough argument can be made that they forced Japans hand with the embargo that was establised Im not sure when that prevented Japan from importing critical resources, for which they were actually fighting the wars they did, like oil.
This is the issue you've already accepted that US intervention in foreign relations is the baseline you've normalized it.
And you don't think that's because you have a military capable of defending your nation from an external threat?
Isn't that similar to the circumstances during WW 2?
>The West has enemies.
>And you don't think that's because you have a military capable of defending your nation from an external threat?
What did Cuba ever do to us?
How many people do you think would seriously support Trump if he said he was going to start a draft for the purpose of invading Iran?
or "Thank a soldier for the freedoms you enjoy."
It would certainly cost him in swing states.
So.
If Canada and the other commonwealth countries hadn't helped out, Canada could be under Nazi control.
Abortion and stoning to death are on two different planes of existence.
No and no.
A military has two primary purposes;  to enact foreign policy when diplomacy and other forms of pressure have failed and to protect national assets.
Germany with Japan would have to invade US mainland to end it or drop a nuke.
The US were supportive of the Allies supplying them with materials but as far as I know public didnt want to join the war directly.
If, if.
With cities in ruins and rampant poverty and hatred for them.
How is it our business if the Vietnamese as a people decided they didn't want to be under the rule of US puppet dictators, and wanted to chart their own path?
The Canadian military will also never be able to defend our territory in the event of an actual invasion, all we have is soft power and the assumption that we'll be protected by our friendly relations with the world's current imperial hegemon.
Politics aside, they are brave individuals and I believe we should support them, but I'm not sure they protected my freedom.
I never said that the hate a terrorist group was feeling couldn't be justified.
That's half million more people who hate us.
I can guarantee you that they would have enough resources to launch, eventually, invasion of the Americans.
I've said this before, but maybe in this context it will stick: And yet, it really wasn't that long ago since the Vietnam War... even more unpopular, had a draft, still went on for a long time.
"These brave men and women fight for our freedom."
9/11 had everyone fired up about Afghanistan.
Of course it could be better but considering the fact we have a history of endless wars to compare it to it is better.
It also seems we have different ideas of the state of the world and american mindset.
I'd also state the preponderance of 'nationwide injunctions' that have happened under Trump will likely bite the Democrats in the ass later too.
So it's quite possible that by the time these orders make it through the courts, the court will be as much as a third made up of Trump appointees, and even more conservative than it is already.
>My point is that if President Yang declares a national emergency and uses that to use funds appropriated by Congress for something else, like Trump has done, the executive defense will rely on trumps action on the wall, which legally is a fitting comparison even if the facts and policy motivation is wildly different.
Remember the 'Pen and Phone'
Ok fair enough, who knows.
Again, you have to consider that there may be only one or two liberal justices left on the court by the time Trump left a second term, if indeed he leaves at all.
But that doesn't make then legally deficient, which is what I'm getting at.
I just mean the legal foundation for them being held unconstitutional and the likelihood that a court would be pushed into directly addressing trumps example due to parties briefing and president warren's legal team using the trump example to defend the climate emergency declaration and use of otherwise appropriated funds.
>All that may be fair enough.
I didn't see republicans in Congress crying foul at any of that in any meaningful way.
But you may be right.
What I'm disagreeing with is the idea that Republicans have to worry about whether it's constitutional or not.
Especially given the inevitability of serious executive action on climate change likely via similar methods as those that trump used with the wall.
That will be the counter to Trumps expanding EO's.
Well Yang won't be president, so that scenario is unlikely.
So, if SCOTUS deemed that in unconstitutional violation of separation of powers, they'd either explicitly or implicitly be stating that trumps action on wall funding was unconstitutional.
I don't think they will care about precedent at all and instead will find ways to rule that whatever President Warren was trying to do was unconstitutional.
I get that, but this would only matter if the court was going to examine the policies of a theoretical future liberal president (provided we continue to have elections) with an at least somewhat objective lens rather than a completely partisan one.
Aside from the dubious scenario of drawing a meaningful and narrow distinction between subsequent use and trumps use of these arguments, it seems like any thoughtful conservative member of Congress applying any measure of foresight must assume that the overreach of today can always be struck down tomorrow.
Maybe the substance was too sexy for them to care about the means.
When trump first argued for funding on the basis of a national security emergency, I saw it pointed out that the same logic, with a lot more evidence to back it up, could be used by a democratic president to declare a national climate emergency and seize the purse strings from congress just like trump has.
Constitutional scholars like to say "you may like the way this case came out today but you may not like it's holding tomorrow".
There is a rich history of each party one-upping the other (and regretting it later)
So I don't think that Republicans have to consider what kind of precedent Trump's policies will set at all.
Well I mean almost every major law gets challenged at some point.
I also don't think it should be taken for granted that the composition and size of the court will be the same in 10 years given the current court being already skewed away from the political demographics of our country and where it is headed
But, doesn't that tacitly assume that there is an understanding that the presidential use of executive power today, even if you substantively approve of the actions, is unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to law?
But some of the folks in Congress and staffing Congress are super smart people equipped with the faculty of foresight.
Does this mean your view has changed?
So two big examples come to mind: executive determination of national emergency for getting funding for the border wall and the trump administration's singularly expansive definition of executive privilege.
>I just mean the legal foundation for them being held unconstitutional and the likelihood that a court would be pushed into directly addressing trumps example due to parties briefing and president warren's legal team using the trump example to defend the climate emergency declaration and use of otherwise appropriated funds.
Hell they won't even allow evidence of corruption to be examined by the public, so they have no reason to think the rest of the conservatives in the government are any less corrupt than they are at this point.
I don't think this just applies to presidential actions, it can apply to legislation too.
I'm not quite so convinced that the court is going to be quite so nakedly partisan on the legal side of things.
But my point is that they would no doubt want something like that to be struck down as executive overreach, which would likely mean striking down trump policy as unconstitutional, which at least some of them must understand, which means some of them are pushing something they understand likely should be constitutional but for the reasons you outlined they know it won't in trumps case
>So, if SCOTUS deemed that in unconstitutional violation of separation of powers, they'd either explicitly or implicitly be stating that trumps action on wall funding was unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court is now majority conservative and has already rendered several rulings favorable to conservative policies, and if Trump wins another election (or possibly even if he doesn't) there's not a bad chance that the next person on the supreme Court will be a conservative too, likely replacing a liberal.
Likewise, a democrat could use trumps executive privilege arguments to shut down a Republican Congress and stop inquiry from non-government officials that would never get coverage previously etc etc.
I think it's still a question of when not if SCOTUS or an appellate court will have to visit this
All that may be fair enough.
So yeah the supreme Court is definitely going to review a lot of Trump's policies and actions, I'm not disagreeing with that.
They could very easily bend to whatever Trump wants
>But my point is that they would no doubt want something like that to be struck down as executive overreach,  which would likely mean striking down trump policy as unconstitutional
My point is that if President Yang declares a national emergency and uses that to use funds appropriated by Congress for something else, like Trump has done, the executive defense will rely on trumps action on the wall, which legally is a fitting comparison even if the facts and policy motivation is wildly different.
But I'm not talking about his policies getting struck down.
And this is the part that I disagree with.
https://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/01/14/obama-on-executive-actions-ive-got-a-pen-and-ive-got-a-phone/
I would tell you that it is more of a follow on to the actions of Obama.
Edit: policies that are based on executive action, particularly without so much as a formal rulemaking process (e.g., an executive order) have the least durability of anything a presidency does and can be undone with a stroke of the pen.
Right and my point is that there's no guarantee this is doing to happen at all.
