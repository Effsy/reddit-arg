It's a pretty bad argument too ultimately, I think the consent argument boils down to the complication that children are less intelligent and mature, lack [foresight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foresight_(psychology)), and that can become a problem if they partake in a risky activity, whether it is a sexual one or a non-sexual one, but if the sex act is indeed harmless, I don't anyone could make a good argument against it either, because not all sexual activities are risky.
So it is better to protect the animal by installing a restrictive law that unfortunately rules out possible ethical sexual interaction.
