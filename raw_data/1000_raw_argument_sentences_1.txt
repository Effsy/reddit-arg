It should be a crime, or you simply don't have an opinion on it?
So if you ND into someone's *face*, the penalty should be you being yelled at as well - does that sound right to you?
In both of these types of offence, there is no need to prove the *mens rea* ('Guilty mind' element of a crime), only the *actus reus* (the 'actually committed an act' element).
Well I used the word inexperienced, didn't I?
We have penalties for things like running red lights because they're *dangerous actions* and people need to be discouraged from performing *dangerous actions*.
It doesn't help them realize why or if they were wrong, and just seems ill suited for conversation, if your intention is to really figure out or explain why something they did, was stupid.
I would say if it's consistent, it's probably okay to say those things, or at least ask about it.
Meaning if there's an unfavorable aspect to a candidate in the results, but more favorable in another aspect, then the pollsters will highlight the good fact, but make no mention of the other fact.
This means that feminists are in favor of men being primarily nurturers while women are providers or any combination of the two (and any gender combination as well).

80% of the energy from a typical gas vehicle is lost in heat- not transfered into useful motion.
The events that took place regarding the Bidens took place before Zelensky became president and there aren't, to my knowledge, any allegations that Zelensky had anything to do with it.
That is the wrong conclusion to make based on the 2016 results.
While conversion of vehicles to electrical, and the growing capacity of clean energy sources provides the ideal long term solution, these look to be too expensive for most of the planet to adopt in the next 20 years, so additional mitigating efforts are needed to save the planet.
The second compelling argument is that it creates a moral hazard against greenhouse gas reduction.
In my case, I was lucky and nobody was coming the other way.
How could you possibly know they are stupid as a 100% truth?
To prevent them from doing this, however would represent a huge amount of overreach from the government, if it was to be enforced legally.
Beyond that, however, it's a free society, and a private business is free to decide what the requirements of each job are.
That prosecutor was also investigating Burisma, which had hired Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.
More people are going to run red lights and more people are going to get killed because you've just lessened the punishment.
The problem is that the Democrats need to fill those in using actual evidence such as witness testimony, documents, etc.

In any case, if polls do not reflect reality, how come most of the major polls tend to agree with each other?
But let's say Trump is able to force the FBI to investigate anyone he wants them to - why then would he not force them to investigate the Bidens?
If you can, CMV.

Suddenly, just a few weeks ago, the House announced it would begin an impeachment inquiry and push for a final vote in just a matter of weeks.

If not for the whistle blower, he might've just gotten what he wanted no problem.
*However* geoengineering is not an acceptable solution to the current kind of climate change.
Only after Joe Biden announced his candidacy and Trump viewed him as a political threat.
So let's say we get rid of it and it's just a ticket.
That last thing is the key.

They raised the minimum wage in ontario from 10 to 14, and literally nothing happened.
By removing deterrent and punishment from bad luck-esq actions, you also removed a huge part of negligence or even straight up criminal behavior.
You're completely missing the point.
I put it in quotes because I see no reason not to include the actual label, in this case: stupid.
As I mentioned, I think Attorney General Barr should have asked Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko to investigate and that Presidents Trump and Zelensky should not have been involved.

Hunter or Joe Biden called as "witnesses" to something they weren't witness to would backfire spectacularly.
The endgoal is near zero emissions, and that's impossible when everyone drives gas vehicles.
> If the American government suspects that an American citizen is guilty of a crime, regardless of where the crime was committed in the world, the American government is the one that would investigate.
So this would absolutely be an example of Ukrainian corruption in that they're essentially paying Hunter Biden to get Joe Biden push out their own politicians.
Another popular argument is, "if two candidates are equal in every way except for the fact that one has a university degree and the other doesn't".
If you can show me where he had concerns about Hunter Biden and Ukraine prior to 2019, then you may have a point.
It's now painfull to watch everything is so dense and cringey.
If someone is in front of me, that same action is illegal.

It is my opinion that if we amplify our current non-geoengineering methods, then it *WILL* be enough to curb climate change to a manageable rate.

One of the duties of the executive branch is to run investigations.

Don't you own your opinion?
if they like to push each other poo good for them but none of that shit for me.
That's not conducive to discussion, and it makes criticism pointless.
Is there a crime alleged that Hunter Biden committed?
Maybe not literally, but they've touched all of these points indirectly.
Who's to say that the Ukrainian investigation wouldn't have expanded to look at Hunter Biden?
Now you're saying:
I can't really imagine contexts in which you should call a stupid person stupid.
If there's a reason to investigate, Ukraine will investigate.
His main platform was anti-corruption, so there is a very valid argument as to why it came up on the call.
So even if there is a 50% increase in minimum wage, that still only loses 10% of the minimum wage jobs.
Those things can absolutely be used to argue the House's case.
There is an abundance of proof, not only from his business career, but also during his presidency.

WHY WAS HE ASKING THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE TO INVESTIGATE AMERICAN CITIZENS?
This is the entire argument.
This is especially true if you look at polls with a rating of A or B (which would roughly correspond to the "pollsters who know what they're doing and want to represent reality accurately").
>BUT HOW IS UKRAINIAN CORRUPTION BEING CURBED BY INVESTIGATIONS INTO *AMERICAN CITIZENS?
So one issue with all of your points is precisely the fact that you worded every one of them as a question.
Again, they report to their direct agencies, not directly to the president.
Regardless, even if he thinks Zelensky is corrupt (even if Zelensky actually is corrupt), Ukraine is still a sovereign nation and Zelensky is its president.
His worth isn't in his innate nature, it's in what he can provide, his character.

The part I'd disagree with is this:

You seem to be mistaken about where Trump suspected the corruption to be.
>calling someone stupid should be okay if it's true **and conversationally appropriate**
You're not actually telling them anything they don't know, you're just making them feel uncomfortable.
So if you ND into someone's *face*, the penalty should be you being yelled at as well - does that sound right to you?
There are many other ways to gauge a candidate, and in my mind, the most effective ways are experiential in nature.
Trump had no problem with corruption in Ukraine before and was even perfectly happy sending them money.
I bring both of these up because - in Australia at least - they entirely answer your question.
Then, this could be done in a remote part of the open ocean with buoys or drones positioned to take samples at various depths and at various distances.
That is a confirmed fact.
I see immense value in it, but believe the application of it in weeding out otherwise perfectly sound candidates for jobs is an improper abuse of the system.
That helps, right?
You're really talking about a law enforcement matter on both the Ukrainian and US sides of the call.
We actually have a number of studies done that try to measure this.
It was ZELENSKY that Trump withheld the aid from, not the previous government.
These roles carried on forward into the post industrial era where now instead of hunting and fighting off other males, men went to work and provided for their family that way (they now had to fight off other males in a business setting).

Yet the guy might get offended if he were to be called inexperienced.
To achieve that end gender roles were created.
In fact, as a new leader, President Zelensky has an interest in knowing if there is corruption affecting his government and doing something about it.
That being said it would also be possible for gasoline engines to become efficient enough to be more eco friendly than electric cars if government's weren't pushing so hard for electric vehicles.
The FBI DOES have a signed treaty with Ukraine, so if Americans needed to be investigated, the FBI is within their authority to do so.
It put me into a financial bind that I'm still trying to climb out of.
Hunter Biden had no great reason that anyone can think of to be on that board of directors (he had no special knowledge or insight regarding that country or industry), which naturally causes you to wonder if he got that job because his father was VPOTUS.
As technology costs fall and new machines are invented, more and more jobs find themselves in a position where the initial cost of machines makes more sense than paying workers to do the machine's job.
Because you are largely responsible for *your* actions.
That's why pollsters usually weight liberal/progressive responders higher in polls, because most quality polls are conducted mainly through landlines (the Internet is notoriously hard to poll).
This is the only corruption he could find that he's worried about and it just so happens to involve the person he considers to be his biggest political rival?

Sure, accelerating tech might one day make robots replace more and more jobs, but a lower minimum wage is about as good of a solution as a bucket is for a sinking ship.

The situation is far fetched because of vehicular manslaughter.
For example, a sock fell in this hard to reach spot once.
Finding qualified applicants is hard and it's a convenient sorting method.
Trump is convinced that large elements of the previous Ukranian government are out to get him, and Zelensky only just took office.
If they talk about him too much, the GOP side will just say "if you're so concerned about Hunter Biden, just bring him in as a witness".

Really?
There's an FBI Director who is the head of the FBI.
I'm not convinced that some of the polling organizations know how to tick all of the boxes to what they are expected to provide, and leave out some data.
They can get the things that Ukraine provides, but we don't have any authority to conduct our own investigation in that country, **and we shouldn't**.
Implementing an automated solution is going to cost millions.
So partial reporting is definitely a problem, but it's a problem with the media, not pollsters.
> In many part of the world, people don't care about racism and homophobia or they see themselves as racist or homophobic like you do guys.
Emancipation from what?
I'm going to start by adding a qualifier:
With Zelensky taking office, they had an opportunity to do something that they probably knew needed to be done for years.
I mean companies are already doing things like that.
Corrupt bureaucrats tend to grow tendrils into their government that can operate independently of the official power structure, at least for a while.
For example I feel weird when I see bunch of Black characters  ( even a black elf lmoa) on Witcher Universe at the Netflix show.
That doesn't mean they're 0% accurate and can't be trusted, though.
Trump has been president for three years and hasn't how did he concerned about Ukraine or Joe Biden or his son.
But we aren't living in a perfect world.
Because big fantasy blockbusters sell well overseas, where you don't need to translate a lot of dialogue or understand a lot of specific cultural details that don't cross over well.
Lmao
But they don't, and the way the political parties and media spin it, I just feel, again, they are less and less relevant.
Not in 2016 during the election when he had every reason to try to slander any Democrat, not in 2017 once he was President, not in 2018.
It's impossible to distinguish a bad luck vs criminal negligence.
It happens, but incredibly rarely.
The reason car accidents of such a nature are considered *manslaughter* is because there was no intent behind the death, but there was still an act of negligence, and there was still a criminal offence leading to the death.
But when you say inaccurate things about someone in anger as a way to hurt them and nothing else... That in my opinion is a true insult.
Otherwise it would be legal.
There's really no necessary connection between these things.
I mean if super powers and vampires are okay but not white people?
And it was.
> The idea is that if someone is driving like an asshole, they have an incentive to stop and accept the lesser charge before they kill someone
He was wholly uninterested until Biden announced his candidacy 4 years after the fact
Commenters inevitably call for harsh punishments, up to treating it the same as murder.
And he also would have never allowed the Russia investigation by the FBI if he had control over what the FBI does.
my main problem is shows that are done with woke propaganda in mind and are ruined by it.
There are varying degrees of recklessness, which may be hard to distinguish by external observers.
It still might be a wrong assumption.
And if you've got a problem with non white people appearing in a tv show... 🤦‍♂️
This would also explain the delay between Trump taking office and asking for an investigation.
But i don't poke around much with other people.
So in essence, what you have is a political process (impeachment) that is being pursued on a strictly partisan basis alleging no *criminal* activity within the articles voted on.
Why only after Biden announced his candidacy did this five-year-old concern, (which had been abated because Hunter Biden no longer worked at Burisma) arise for Trump?
You would probably not go to prison at all, though you would be liable for millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit.
Why not be a little courteous to the new president and let him get oriented first?

If every 2 months you see a story about "Trump's approval ratings are falling" it creates a sense that his approval is awful and getting worse (since they don't report when it pops back up the next week), but looking at the [actual results](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) (again, aggregated which helps avoid outlier polls) we see that his approval ratings have been pretty steady.
Impeachment is a political process by nature.

And its seems you are struggling as well.
These are American citizens & the FBI can investigate American citizens outside of the US.

There's also one more thing that you need to keep in mind.
The same action may be present in both cases, but the consequences differ drastically, and that is something the court takes into account.
And the next time that same party needs a poll to support one of their objectives, they hire them again.
He did the thing Democrats accuse him of - he's just saying it wasn't wrong for him to have withheld the aid and then hiding all of the evidence that proves it WAS wrong.
There is a system in Central Europe (at least in Germany) where students have to test into university to even be considered in the first place.
yeah this is not pratical.
That rightfully has punishments associated with it more severe than the punishment for the negligent act alone.
In jobs that are vulnerable to automation, the only reason they're not yet automated is because the initial cost of replacing workers with machines is high and the continuing cost of employing people is lower than that.

Your original view as stated in your original post is:
WHY WAS HE ASKING THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE TO INVESTIGATE AMERICAN CITIZENS?
Fourth, there's the fact the president involved himself directly - why is he leading the charge on that front in the first place?
It's complete horsecrap that doesn't stand up to 15 seconds of scrutiny, but if you view it through that lens then his actions follow from it.
It's like the dials just move up and down at a whim, depending on what makes for a better answer.
President Zelensky's anti-corruption agenda.161 President Trump's own Department of Defense, in
The fact that the branches of government meant to be checks and balances on the Executive have been denied the ability to perform that vital role is entirely admissible evidence of abuse of power.
It appears that Trump wanted to create the appearance of Ukraine choosing to launch an investigation all on their own without any visible US ass-puppetry.
I am totally open to making the punishment harsher as a practical measure, if lowering the punishment would really make murders like this more common.
He made a move for an investigation into a political rival to be announced.
- which looks kind of damning if it's all about corruption he simply cares about a lot.
They also have inquired heavily into why Giuliani, Sondland, and co. were responsible for this instead of formal channels.
I'm asking for help right now.

They have an ethically moral argument for being able to do so since other countries were able to.

Unless your position is particularly superfluous or significantly more cost effective to replace, one would expect folks making minimum wage and full-time folks to be on the chopping block ahead of you if your employer actually did make cuts.

Recycling a heavy metal from an old battery is more profitable than mining new heavy metals.
Do you think he should face more charges than just petty theft?
So, asking a corrupt country to hold investigations is actually fairly normal.
Procedural roadblocks, no.
Stupid or not, they are far from worthless.
The first is unintended consequences.
To do so, the House Intelligence Committee **declared that it would not subpoena** a host of witnesses who have direct knowledge of any quid pro quo.
Otherwise, we end up in a situation of putting people in jail for years for a single DUI, or if that's too severe, hardly punishing people who kill, and leaving dangerously reckless people on the streets.
We have a good understanding of the outcomes of these processes, such as the minor irritation to sensitive humans, such as those with asthma.

So, Zelensky ran on a campaign of rooting out corruption in the Ukrainian government.
Trump saw in Zelensky someone who might actually be interested in rooting out the corruption.
There is incongruity in Trump's claim to be concerned that ZELENSKY was corrupt but at the same time pressuring him to announce this investigation.
The allegation that Trump fired Comey to stop the Russian investigation is baseless.
Can we agree that if the Bidens (or even just Joe Biden) are corrupt in their dealings with Ukraine, that that's something the American people ought to know before voting for him in November?
In the first case, you're simply breaking some traffic violations.

Let's say someone went to snatch an old lady's purse, and in the process, she fell, broke a hip, and later died.
And here is the kicker.
you've got to watch the house testimony.
So...There's this important corruption issue and the President, a very powerful man, just sits on in waiting for the light in darkness that is Zelensky*, which just so happens to coincide very advantageously with his own personal political goals and you're ready to believe these are entirely unrelated?
Those two statements seem pretty contradictory and an indication that your view has been changed, at least in part.
The other extreme option is to only judge by consequence and not intent.
We don't know if Biden did anything corrupt, but Trump is all ready to call him corrupt based solely on his FEELINGS, but without any evidence to back it up.
The punishment is different because the outcome is different.
While you might be right on the *authority* aspect, but this is quite literally why we have intelligence agencies.

You're arguing a technicality about an out-of-context quote.
For instance, Trump's implausible claim that he withheld the aid from Ukraine because he suspected Zelensky was corrupt.
The whole idea is that Biden pushed to have a "corrupt politician" removed (Viktor Shokin).

He answers to the DOJ, which up until Trump got involved, was a nonpartisan organization.

People will call any unconventional character "political propaganda" today while ignoring the political propaganda that they agree with.
When you look here, [for example](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/), you can see that most polls were within an error margin of one another.
Job adverts always put down higher requirements than the minimum they'd accept, to try and deter people who are just spam-applying to everything that even vaguely applies to them.
This whole situation strikes me as really far-fetched and not a good reason to design our laws around.
This is what I'm understanding.
If you just remove the consequence part then even the simple act of pouring water on the ground can lead you to 20 years in jail because you never take into account the different consequences.
Well, you'd be guilty of negligent driving, and the mens rea element is entirely irrelevant.

Negligence requires you to unjustifiably fail to perceive a substantial risk to human safety.
Here is an article from the [NY Times dating back to 2015 asking questions about eh potential conflict of interest and appearance of impropriety of Hunter Biden's business relations coinciding with Joe Biden's official work as VP](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html).
I think more research and more knowledge is always good, and if we can find a route to doing this works and is safe with acceptable risks, THEN we should aggressively do it.
Using hemp for paper, rope, cloth and we can make sustainable biodegradable plastics.
But that can easily be overcome by tools or training.
It usually depends on how the other person sees it.
I don't know much about Ukrainian politics, but I assume that their Presidents (like our Presidents) have a lot to get done in his first few months in office.
So much so that it influences people based on bad reporting of the polls.
I agree and always try to say "acting stupid" and make it clear that I think what the person is doing/saying at that moment is nonsensical and go on to explain why I think so.

But the fact that someone died was just unlucky and shouldn't cause the punishment to be significantly harsher.
Acting as if Biden took an illegal action in order to protect him, or to thank the company for doing so, on the other hand, isn't based in reality.
Punishments are measured as to be the best possible compromise between deterrent and fairnes (which we call justice in law).
I am taking the word "stupid" as an example.
**That doesn't mean that statistics aren't a hugely important aspect of understanding our modern world, and polls are an important part of that.
There is no possible justification in reducing the penalty for taking someone's life when it is not necessary.

Well first of all, because Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election.
In the 2016 election where one particular candidate got a huge response among voters with low levels of education it makes your polls very susceptible to error especially if you're polls don't happen to capture a perfectly representative amount of people at each education level.

That being said, nobody is suggesting that President Zelensky personally investigate any of this.
The only three direct conversations with President Trump do not contain a statement of a quid pro quo and two expressly deny such a pre-condition.
As I've said in another thread, I think that Attorney General Barr should have spoken to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General about the Bidens and that both presidents should have stayed out of it.
Good pollsters use better methodologies, have transparent procedures, and adjust to the greatest extent possible for confounds and biases.
How?
> First off, the investigation into Burisma was about a time from before Hunter Biden was on their payroll, so there was no personal benefit to the Bidens to stop it.

Only after I left did I find out that all surveys were in targeted areas to affect the results, and that the company was funded by one of that state's political parties.

I'm personally not so against trading the Bidens for Bolton or Mulvaney or both, but that opens up a lot of room for the White House counsel to obfuscate the whole trial, focus everything on the Bidens, and make it so that the trial becomes a shit show about the Bidens instead of it being a trial about Trump.

It's ludicrous to believe that Trump was so concerned about the son of a politician being given a 6 figure job that he wasn't qualified for when his own WH is filled with his kids and the kids of his donors and supporters in high paying jobs they're wholly unqualified to hold.
So there was importance but not urgency to getting this work done.
That's just the risk they took, entirely out of their own free will.
Most of the tv shows, movies, games...etc constantly try to avoid 'offensive content' and constantly trying to put messages about social justice.
If they sample 100 people and 60 of them are women and 40 men, but they know the demographics of the area they're targeting is 51% women and 49% men, what they'll do is their weight the responses of the sampled women by the ratio of 60 to 51.

I agree.
Within the context of Black Panther, it matters which characters are of which race.
But point is doing that alone doesn't solve the issue, since we can't catch up to our carbon output if we don't entirely kill all of our fossil fuel burning.

This could then be compared to typical variation over the same period and compared in a significance test.

So although one coal power plant creates way more CO2 than an individual car, a coal power plant gives off less CO2 than an equivalent amount of cars cumulatively generating the same amount of power.
The implication is that Joe Biden interfered in the Ukrainian investigation.
As electric cars become more and more prominent, there will be more and more companies taking an interest in innovating in that market space, and eventually their environmental impact will be less and less.

Several of the potential methodologies are directly analogous to natural phenomena.
Schiff explicitly made the argument last night during the procedure votes, I forget for which witness.
The implication of "manslaughter should be the same penalty as running a red light" is that both should be a ticket; the implication of "running a red light should be the same penalty as manslaughter" is that both should be a jail sentence.

At the very least, a degree is an indicator that they're more likely to be promotable.

Perhaps a better way of looking at it is that in Scenario A - where you drive a red light and just get a ticket - only one crime occurs (negligent driving).
This was partly said to be because it would create jobs.
There hasn't been a movement to free men from these professions or to get women into them, only the nice positions that are safe and pay well.

Since nobody has found a better reason than that latter fact for Hunter to be on Burisma's board, asking about the meaning of that makes sense.
Jeez, if there's importance but not urgency, why ask for an announcement at such a dubious moment in the first place?
Not so that you can increase the punishments on big crimes, but so you can reduce the punishments on small crimes.

At a loose definition, manslaughter refers to any case where negligence or criminal conduct leads to an (unintended) loss of life.
There are some facts you're ignoring here though.
Just because one American citizen was formerly involved with Burisma (were the Bidens the ONLY Americans involved with Burisma?
Biden didn't covertly move to get the Ukrainian prosecutor removed - he did it out in the open, in accordance with US foreign policy.
>'m open to valid legal arguments, but not to the typical Trumpian schoolyard antics.
Of course, there are many benefits to using electric cars like less maintenance, no clutch, no gears, no oil changes, more boot space, etc which I won't deny but what I don't get is how people are made to believe that by using electric cars we can save the environment which is not true.
I just generally meant using words like stupid which are considered offensive or wrong to say.
But there's also the fossil fuels used to make the car, fossil fuels used to extract the crude oil, fossil fuel energy used to refine the crude oil into gasoline, fossil fuel used to transport the gasoline to gas stations, fossil fuel to keep the lights on at the gas stations, fossil fuel to build the gas stations, etc.
You simply called me stupid and didn't explain why I'm stupid.

Edit to add:
The economic incentive of all parties is to use the cheapest form of energy, but the best outcome for all parties is the drastic global reduction of carbon, methane, and other greenhouse gasses.
I'm also not sure what it has to do with my original view.
Its the abuse of power and contempt of congress which is really bad, and that is exactly what they hit him with.
And yes, although currently electric cars cause environmental damage in other areas, innovation doesn't happen overnight.
Masculinism should be the return of the balance either.

It seems like the blanket argument for "weeding out" candidates is to plaster on a degree requirement for jobs, because then, at least those without degrees can be eliminated.

Much of the power is lost along the way so power cables can't be too long.
I'm not sure what gerrymandering is doing in there; district lines are known at the time of the polls and thus are accounted for.
So electric cars put more energy in the bin that is possible to get away from fossil fuels.
Now, it's 100% possible that what Biden did was completely on the up and up.
It's entirely true that people with Bachelor's degrees may be less qualified than those without, but it tends not to be the case.
Another way to argue your point is that let's say killing someone is the same punishment as not killing someone while running the red light.
